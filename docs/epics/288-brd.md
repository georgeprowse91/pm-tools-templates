# Business Requirements Document (BRD) — Epic 288: Template Customization Web Interface (MVP)

Version: 0.1 (Draft)
Owner: mirichard
Date: 2025-08-09

1. Business Objective
Provide a browser-based experience for customizing project management templates with real-time preview, accessible UI, and simple collaboration, improving adoption and reducing friction from static file workflows.

2. Scope (MVP)
- In scope:
  - Editor for 5 templates (Project Charter, Risk Register, Stakeholder Communication Plan, Sprint Planning, Executive Status Report)
  - Validation, completion % indicator, live Markdown preview
  - Download Markdown
  - Basic versioning (save/list/restore) and diff
  - Experimental collaboration for Charter (feature-flagged)
  - Accessibility conformance (WCAG 2.1 AA) with automated checks
- Out of scope (deferred):
  - OAuth save-to-repo, DOCX/PDF export, enterprise SSO, advanced analytics

3. Stakeholders and Users
- Primary: Project Managers, PMO, team leads
- Secondary: Executives (for outputs), repository maintainers

4. Success Metrics (MVP)
- 100+ customizations/month
- 80% completion rate for template customization
- a11y tests pass in CI; keyboard-only demo passes
- Positive UAT feedback (≥4/5) from 2–3 evaluators

5. Functional Requirements
- FR1: Render schema-driven forms for each template with validation
- FR2: Display completion percentage based on required fields
- FR3: Live Markdown preview reflects edits under 500ms warm
- FR4: Download current content as .md
- FR5: Save named versions, list, restore, show diff of two versions
- FR6: Collaboration (Charter only) — real-time sync when enabled

6. Non-functional Requirements
- NFR1: Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA checks via axe and manual keyboard test
- NFR2: Performance: preview warm updates < 500ms under typical loads
- NFR3: Security/Privacy: no PII persistence in anonymous mode; collaboration off by default
- NFR4: Reliability: feature flags to disable experimental features

7. Constraints & Assumptions
- No server persistence for MVP (local/session storage only)
- Collaboration requires local y-websocket server for demo
- DOCX/PDF export deferred per ADR defaults

8. Risks & Mitigations
- R1: Collaboration instability → feature flag, Charter-only scope
- R2: Export fidelity (deferred) → deliver markdown first, plan Pandoc integration later
- R3: a11y regressions → axe CI and manual keyboard checks

9. Acceptance Criteria
- AC1: All 5 editors render with validation, completion %, and pass a11y checks
- AC2: Live preview and markdown download work for each template
- AC3: Version save/list/restore/diff work and are demonstrable
- AC4: Charter collaboration demo works with local ws server
- AC5: UAT scripts execute successfully; artifacts (screenshots, downloads) attached

10. UAT Plan (see docs/for-users/template-customization.md for script)
- Perform UAT flows via automated Playwright tests and manual demo
- Collect screenshots + test outputs and attach to Epic 288
