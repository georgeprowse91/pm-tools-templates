## Introduction

Choosing the right project management methodology is a critical decision that impacts project success. This guide compares the major project management methodologies available in our template library and provides guidance on selecting the appropriate approach based on your specific project characteristics and organizational context.

Each methodology has its strengths and weaknesses, and understanding these can help you make an informed decision or create a customized approach that combines elements from different methodologies.
