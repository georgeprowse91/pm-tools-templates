## 📊 Quick Assessment (5 minutes)

### Answer these key questions:

**1. How well-defined are your requirements?**
- 🟢 **Highly defined** - You know exactly what needs to be built
- 🟡 **Partially defined** - Core requirements clear, details will emerge
- 🔴 **Emerging/Unclear** - Requirements will evolve based on learning

**2. How likely are requirements to change?**
- 🟢 **Minimal changes** - Requirements are stable and unlikely to change
- 🟡 **Some changes** - Changes expected in specific areas
- 🔴 **Frequent changes** - Requirements will evolve continuously

**3. What's your delivery expectation?**
- 🟢 **Final delivery** - Complete solution delivered at project end
- 🟡 **Milestone-based** - Major deliveries at key milestones
- 🔴 **Incremental** - Regular, frequent deliveries throughout project

**4. What are your compliance/documentation needs?**
- 🟢 **Extensive** - Regulatory, audit, or contractual requirements
- 🟡 **Moderate** - Some documentation required for governance
- 🔴 **Minimal** - Just enough documentation to support delivery

**5. How involved will stakeholders be?**
- 🟢 **Milestone reviews** - Stakeholders engage at planned checkpoints
- 🟡 **Mixed involvement** - Some ongoing, some milestone-based
- 🔴 **Continuous** - Stakeholders actively involved throughout
