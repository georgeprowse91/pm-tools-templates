## 🔄 Methodology Selection Decision Framework

### 1. Primary Drivers of Methodology Selection

The following factors have the greatest influence on methodology selection:

**High impact factors:**
1. **Requirements certainty** - How well-defined are the deliverables?
2. **Stakeholder engagement model** - How will stakeholders provide input?
3. **Delivery cadence** - What rhythm of delivery provides the most value?
4. **Risk tolerance** - What's the organization's attitude toward uncertainty?
5. **Compliance requirements** - What governance standards must be met?

**Methodology alignment indicators:**

| Factor | Traditional Indicator | Agile Indicator | 
|-------|---------------------|----------------|
| Requirements | Stable from start | Evolve throughout |
| Stakeholders | Prefer oversight | Prefer involvement |
| Delivery | Final handoff | Incremental value |
| Risk attitude | Risk-averse | Risk-tolerant |
| Documentation | Comprehensive | Minimal viable |

### 2. Hybrid Approach Evaluation Criteria

**Consider a hybrid approach when:**

1. **Mixed certainty levels** - Some aspects are well-defined while others will emerge
2. **Varied stakeholder groups** - Some need regular involvement, others milestone reviews
3. **Multiple project components** - Different work streams have different characteristics
4. **Compliance + innovation tension** - Need to satisfy both governance and adaptability
5. **Scaling transition** - Organization moving from traditional to agile practices

**Hybrid composition options:**

1. **Phase-based hybrid** - Traditional planning and initiation, agile execution
2. **Component-based hybrid** - Traditional for stable elements, agile for evolving parts
3. **Layer-based hybrid** - Agile teams with traditional program governance
4. **Ceremony-based hybrid** - Modified ceremonies that blend approaches
5. **Documentation-based hybrid** - Agile delivery with traditional documentation

### 3. Tailoring Your Methodology

No methodology is one-size-fits-all. Consider these tailoring dimensions:

1. **Ceremony frequency** - Adjust meeting cadence based on team needs
2. **Documentation level** - Scale documentation to risk and compliance needs
3. **Planning horizon** - Determine appropriate planning detail and timeframe
4. **Governance rigor** - Align oversight with project risk profile
5. **Team structure** - Design team composition and roles for project needs
