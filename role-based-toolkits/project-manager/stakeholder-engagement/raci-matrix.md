## 1. RACI Matrix Overview

### 1.1 Purpose
The RACI Matrix clearly defines roles and responsibilities for project activities, decisions, and deliverables to ensure accountability and avoid confusion.

### 1.2 RACI Definitions
- **R - Responsible**: The person who performs the work or makes the decision
- **A - Accountable**: The person ultimately answerable for the completion and quality
- **C - Consulted**: People who provide input and expertise (two-way communication)
- **I - Informed**: People who need to be kept up-to-date (one-way communication)

### 1.3 RACI Rules
- Every activity must have at least one **R** (Responsible)
- Every activity must have only one **A** (Accountable)
- Minimize the number of **C** (Consulted) to avoid delays
- Use **I** (Informed) sparingly to avoid information overload

## 7. RACI Guidelines and Best Practices

### 7.1 Creating Effective RACI Matrices
1. **Start with Activities**: List all key activities and decisions first
2. **Identify Roles**: Include all relevant roles and stakeholders
3. **Assign Responsibilities**: Use RACI definitions consistently
4. **Validate with Team**: Review with team members for accuracy
5. **Keep Updated**: Revise as project evolves

### 7.2 Common RACI Mistakes to Avoid
- **Too Many As**: Only one person should be Accountable
- **No Rs**: Every activity needs someone Responsible
- **Too Many Cs**: Excessive consultation slows decisions
- **Unclear Roles**: Roles should be specific and well-defined
- **Static Matrix**: Update as project and team changes

### 7.3 RACI Validation Checklist
- [ ] Each activity has exactly one A (Accountable)
- [ ] Each activity has at least one R (Responsible)
- [ ] C (Consulted) roles are kept to minimum necessary
- [ ] I (Informed) roles are relevant and necessary
- [ ] All team members understand their assignments
- [ ] Matrix covers all critical activities and decisions

## 8. Communication and Implementation

### 8.1 RACI Communication Plan
1. **Draft Review**: Share draft with key stakeholders
2. **Team Workshop**: Conduct session to review and refine
3. **Final Approval**: Get formal approval from project sponsor
4. **Distribution**: Share final version with all team members
5. **Orientation**: Brief new team members on their roles

### 8.2 RACI Monitoring
- **Weekly Check-ins**: Verify roles are being followed
- **Issue Resolution**: Address role conflicts quickly
- **Performance Review**: Assess effectiveness quarterly
- **Updates**: Revise matrix as needed

### 8.3 Role Conflict Resolution
1. **Identify Conflict**: Clarify the specific disagreement
2. **Review Matrix**: Check current role assignments
3. **Stakeholder Discussion**: Meet with affected parties
4. **Update Matrix**: Revise assignments if needed
5. **Communicate Changes**: Inform all team members

## 9. Customization Guidelines

### 9.1 Adapting for Project Size
**Small Projects (<6 months, <5 people):**
- Combine roles where appropriate
- Focus on critical activities only
- Simplify to essential RACI assignments

**Large Projects (>12 months, >20 people):**
- Break down by work streams or phases
- Create detailed matrices for each area
- Include more stakeholder categories

### 9.2 Methodology-Specific RACI

#### Agile/Scrum Projects
- Include Scrum roles (Product Owner, Scrum Master)
- Focus on sprint-level activities
- Emphasize collaborative decision-making

#### Traditional/Waterfall Projects
- Phase-gate specific matrices
- Formal approval processes
- Clear hierarchical responsibilities

## 10. RACI Matrix Maintenance

### 10.1 Review Schedule
- **Weekly**: Quick review during team meetings
- **Monthly**: Formal review of effectiveness
- **Phase Transitions**: Update for new phase activities
- **Team Changes**: Revise when team composition changes

### 10.2 Version Control
- Maintain version history
- Document all changes and rationale
- Communicate updates to all stakeholders
- Archive previous versions

### 10.3 Lessons Learned
- Capture what worked well
- Identify improvement opportunities
- Document best practices for future projects
- Share insights with other project teams
