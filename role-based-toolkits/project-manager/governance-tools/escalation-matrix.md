## Overview

The Project Escalation Matrix defines the structured approach for escalating issues, risks, and decisions that cannot be resolved at the current level. It ensures timely resolution while maintaining appropriate governance oversight and accountability.

---

## Escalation Principles

### When to Escalate
- **Issue Severity:** Impacts project objectives significantly
- **Decision Authority:** Exceeds current level authority limits
- **Resource Constraints:** Cannot be resolved with available resources

### When NOT to Escalate
- Issues within normal operational scope
- Decisions within assigned authority levels
- Problems with clear resolution paths
- Minor delays that don't impact milestones
- Personality conflicts that can be mediated
