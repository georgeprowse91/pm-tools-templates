# Portfolio Prioritization Model

Weighted scoring example (adjust weights to context):
- Strategic Alignment: 30%
- ROI/NPV (or Value): 25%
- Risk Reduction / Compliance: 15%
- Customer Impact: 15%
- Effort/Cost (inverse score): 10%
- Time Criticality: 5%

Scoring Table (1–5):
- 1 = Very Low, 5 = Very High (invert Effort/Cost)

Formula:
- Total Score = Σ(weight_i × score_i)

Instructions:
- Normalize weights sum to 100.
- Calibrate with 3–5 known initiatives.
- Reassess quarterly during portfolio governance.
