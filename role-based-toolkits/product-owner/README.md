## 📝 Backlog Management

### Product Backlog Structure
**Organize work to maximize value delivery**

### **[→ Download: Backlog Management Template](backlog-management-template.md)**

**Backlog Hierarchy:**
```
Epic
├── Feature
│   ├── User Story
│   │   ├── Task
│   │   └── Task
│   └── User Story
└── Feature
```

**Backlog States:**
- **Ice Box** - Ideas for future consideration
- **Ready** - Defined and estimated, ready for sprint
- **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- **Done** - Completed and accepted

### Prioritization Frameworks

**MoSCoW Method:**
- **Must Have** - Critical for release success
- **Should Have** - Important but not critical
- **Could Have** - Nice to have if time permits
- **Won't Have** - Not in current scope

**Value vs. Effort Matrix:**
- **High Value, Low Effort** - Quick wins (do first)
- **High Value, High Effort** - Major projects (plan carefully)
- **Low Value, Low Effort** - Fill-in work (do if time)
- **Low Value, High Effort** - Don't do (usually)
<a id="download-prioritization-framework-guideprioritization-framework-guidemd"></a>

**Kano Model:**
- **Basic Needs** - Expected functionality (must have)
- **Performance Needs** - More is better (linear satisfaction)
- **Excitement Needs** - Unexpected delight (exponential satisfaction)

## ✍️ User Story Writing

### User Story Format
**Capture requirements from user perspective**

I want to save items to a wishlist
So that I can easily find and purchase them later
```

### Acceptance Criteria
**Define clear completion criteria**

**Given-When-Then Format:**
```
Given [initial context]
When [action taken]
Then [expected outcome]
```

**Example:**

When I click the "Add to Wishlist" button
Then the item is saved to my wishlist
And I see a confirmation message
And the button changes to "Remove from Wishlist"
```
