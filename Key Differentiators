Key Differentiators vs. Smartsheet & Jira

Our PM Tools Templates repo offers unique value that complements (rather than duplicates) what Smartsheet or Jira provide:

1. Multi-Tool, Vendor-Agnostic Templates
   - Word/Excel/PPT artifacts plus export-ready designs for MS Project, Trello, GitHub Projects, Asana, etc.  
   - Standardize processes across platforms or work completely offline.

2. Open-Source & Git-Centric Collaboration
   - MIT-licensed, full Git history, branching, PR reviews and CI checks.  
   - No proprietary backend—your team owns every change.

3. CLI-Driven Project Scaffolding
   - `template-generator-cli` automates creation of a full project skeleton (folders, docs, naming conventions).  
   - Eliminates manual board and scheme setup required in Jira.

4. Curated, Best-Practice Starter Kits
   - Role-based kits (e.g. “First-Time PM,” “Transformation Lead”) and industry-specific bundles (pharma, construction, finance).  
   - Up-and-running in minutes with proven artifacts—far beyond Jira’s blank templates.

5. Living Roadmap & Community Governance
   - Public ROADMAP.md and issue-driven ENHANCEMENT_RECOMMENDATIONS.md for transparent planning and voting.  
   - Anyone can propose, discuss, and track new features via GitHub issues.

6. Full-Fidelity Example Artifacts
   - Completed sample templates show exactly how to populate each form.  
   - Jira boards/issues alone don’t teach “here’s what a real charter looks like.”

7. Zero-Cost, Self-Hosted
   - Clone or fork and you own 100%—no per-user fees, no subscription tiers, no feature gates.  
   - Avoid escalating licensing costs common with enterprise SaaS tools.
