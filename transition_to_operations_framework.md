# TRANSITION TO OPERATIONS FRAMEWORK

## Framework Overview

### Purpose
This framework provides a structured approach for transitioning project deliverables from implementation to operational state. It ensures a smooth handover that maintains service continuity, preserves project value, and establishes sustainable operations.

### Scope
This framework covers the critical period from project completion through operational stabilization, typically spanning 3-6 months post-implementation. It addresses people, process, technology, and governance aspects of the transition.

### Key Principles
- **Continuity**: Maintain uninterrupted service during transition
- **Knowledge Transfer**: Ensure complete transfer of project knowledge to operations
- **Sustainability**: Establish operations that can maintain and improve project outcomes
- **Accountability**: Clear ownership and responsibility for ongoing operations
- **Measurement**: Defined metrics to track operational success
