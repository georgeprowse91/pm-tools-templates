## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **Scope Creep Risk** - Epic has been open 85 days, indicating potential complexity issues
   - *Mitigation:* Phased delivery with clear scope boundaries and stakeholder sign-offs

2. **Integration Complexity** - Connecting 6 major components across 3 methodologies
   - *Mitigation:* Incremental integration testing and modular design approach

3. **User Adoption** - Complex suite may overwhelm users
   - *Mitigation:* Progressive disclosure, guided wizards, and role-specific entry points

### Medium-Risk Items
1. **Resource Dependencies** - Requires coordination across multiple domains
2. **Quality Assurance** - Large template volume requires systematic validation
3. **Documentation Debt** - Existing gaps may compound during rapid development

## Success Metrics & Validation

### Quantitative Metrics
- **Template Coverage:** 100% completion of 6 major components
- **User Adoption:** 100+ program managers using templates within 90 days
- **User Satisfaction:** 90% satisfaction rating (target from issue)
- **Integration Success:** Seamless workflow across all 6 components

### Qualitative Metrics
- **Strategic Alignment:** Templates support organizational objectives
- **Methodology Integration:** Works across Traditional/Agile/Hybrid approaches  
- **Scalability:** Supports programs from 3-50+ projects
- **Professional Standards:** Aligns with PMI, SAFe, and industry best practices
