- Phase-gate approvals for change initiatives
- Detailed documentation and training plans
- Risk-based change impact assessments

#### Agile Change Management
- Iterative change adoption
- Continuous stakeholder feedback
- Sprint-based change implementation
- Retrospective-driven improvements
- Cross-functional team collaboration

#### Hybrid Change Management
- Balanced formal and adaptive approaches

## Implementation Guidelines

### Selecting the Right Approach

**Use Traditional Change Management When:**
- High-risk, high-impact organizational changes
- Regulatory or compliance-driven changes
- Large-scale enterprise transformations
- Formal governance requirements
- Stakeholders prefer structured, predictable approaches

**Use Agile Change Management When:**
- Iterative product or service improvements
- Technology adoption with evolving requirements
- Team-based operational changes
- Rapid market response initiatives
- Stakeholders comfortable with experimentation

**Use Hybrid Change Management When:**
- Complex programs with multiple change initiatives
- Organization transitioning between methodologies
- Mix of operational and strategic changes
- Varying stakeholder comfort with change approaches
- Need for both governance and agility

### Getting Started

1. **Assess Current State**: Use appropriate assessment tools for your methodology
2. **Define Desired State**: Create clear vision using methodology-specific techniques
3. **Plan the Journey**: Select templates and tools aligned with your approach
4. **Execute with Discipline**: Follow methodology guidelines while remaining responsive
5. **Measure and Adapt**: Use feedback to improve change adoption and processes

## Integration with Existing PM Processes

This framework integrates seamlessly with existing project management processes:
