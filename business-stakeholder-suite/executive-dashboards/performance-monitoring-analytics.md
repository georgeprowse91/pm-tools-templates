# Performance Monitoring & Analytics

## 📊 Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing performance monitoring and analytics for the executive dashboards. It focuses on usage metrics, performance health, user behavior tracking, and system diagnostics to ensure optimal functionality and user experience.

## 📋 Key Objectives
1. **User Engagement:** Capture and analyze how executives interact with dashboards.
2. **Performance Metrics:** Monitor load times, refresh rates, and system responsiveness.
3. **Usage Analytics:** Track which dashboards are most accessed and how frequently.
4. **System Health:** Ensure data pipelines, integrations, and connections remain stable.

## 📡 Implementation Plan

### 1. Data Collection
- **Web Analytics Tool:** Integrate tools like Google Analytics or Matomo to capture user interactions and navigation patterns.
- **System Logs:** Capture server logs to analyze performance bottlenecks and errors.
- **API Monitoring:** Use tools like Prometheus or Grafana for real-time API monitoring.

### 2. User Engagement Metrics
- **Dashboard Access Rates:** Track unique and repeat user visits.
- **Session Durations:** Measure how long users stay on each dashboard.
- **Interaction Heatmaps:** Analyze areas of high interaction to improve UX.

### 3. Performance Monitoring
- **Load Times:** Continuously monitor and optimize dashboard load times.
- **Data Refresh Rates:** Ensure data feeds are updating as expected.
- **Error Tracking:** Log and categorize errors to rectify immediately.

### 4. Reporting & Alerts
- **Usage Reports:** Provide insight into dashboard adoption using visual reports.
- **Performance Alerts:** Instantiate alerts for slow load times or connection failures.
- **Health Dashboards:** Create meta-dashboards that focus on system performance.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Web Analytics:** Google Analytics, Matomo
- **Performance Monitoring:** Prometheus, Grafana
- **Log Management:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Alerting Systems:** PagerDuty, Opsgenie
