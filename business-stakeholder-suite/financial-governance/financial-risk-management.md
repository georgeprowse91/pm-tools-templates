#### Risk Evaluation Framework
```
Impact Assessment:
Financial Impact Scale:

- Moderate ($100K-$1M): Notable but manageable impact
- Minor ($10K-$100K): Limited operational impact
- Negligible (<$10K): Minimal financial consequence

Probability Assessment:
Likelihood Scale:
- Very High (>80%): Almost certain to occur
- High (60-80%): Likely to occur
- Medium (40-60%): Possible occurrence
- Low (20-40%): Unlikely but possible
- Very Low (<20%): Rare occurrence

Time Horizon:
- Immediate (0-3 months): Urgent attention required
- Short-term (3-12 months): Near-term planning needed
- Medium-term (1-3 years): Strategic consideration
- Long-term (3+ years): Strategic planning horizon
```

#### Risk Scoring Matrix
```
Risk Score = Impact × Probability × Time Factor

Risk Priority Categories:
- Critical (Score 15-25): Immediate action required
- High (Score 10-14): Priority management needed
- Medium (Score 5-9): Regular monitoring required
- Low (Score 1-4): Periodic review sufficient

Risk Heat Map:
           Very Low  Low    Medium  High   Very High
Catastrophic  5      10      15      20      25
Major         4       8      12      16      20
Moderate      3       6       9      12      15
Minor         2       4       6       8      10
Negligible    1       2       3       4       5
