## Common Facilitation Challenges

### Challenge: Users Focus Only on Problems
**Solution**: Start with "What Works Well" section, celebrate successes

### Challenge: Vague or General Feedback
**Solution**: Ask "Can you show me an example?" and "What specifically...?"

### Challenge: Feature Requests vs. Problem Focus
**Solution**: Ask "What problem would that solve?" to understand root needs

### Challenge: Conflicting User Opinions
**Solution**: Capture all perspectives, validate with broader user base

### Challenge: Limited Time for Thorough Feedback
**Solution**: Focus on 3-4 key sections per session, rotate focus
