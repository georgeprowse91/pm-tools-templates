## Pattern Analysis - Phase 3 Success Factors

### 1. Industry Directory Structure Understanding
**Key Finding:** Industry specializations have well-organized subdirectories but suffer from:
- Missing files in expected locations
- Existing files with slightly different names
- Cross-references to methodology frameworks outside industry directories

### 2. High-Impact Template Prioritization
**Strategy:** Focus on cybersecurity templates first due to:
- High business value and regulatory compliance needs
- Universal applicability across industries
- Strong demand in current threat landscape
- Clear linkage to governance frameworks from Phase 2

### 3. Cross-Directory Linking Patterns
**Discovery:** Many industry-specific templates can leverage existing files in:
- Methodology frameworks (DevOps, Agile)
- Essential templates (governance, planning)
- Other industry specializations (risk assessments)
