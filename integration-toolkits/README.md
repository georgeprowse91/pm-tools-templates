## 🛠️ **Integration Architecture**

### **🏗️ System Architecture Patterns**

**Hub-and-Spoke Model:**
- Central integration platform (e.g., Zapier, Microsoft Power Automate)
- Spoke connections to individual tools
- Centralized data transformation and routing
- Single point of control and monitoring

**Point-to-Point Integration:**
- Direct API connections between tools
- Custom integration scripts and workflows
- Higher performance but more complex management
- Best for high-volume, low-latency integrations

**Event-Driven Architecture:**
- Tools publish events to message queues
- Subscribers react to relevant events
- Loosely coupled and highly scalable
- Ideal for complex, multi-tool workflows

### **🔐 Security & Compliance**
- **API Authentication** - OAuth 2.0, API keys, service accounts
- **Data Encryption** - In-transit and at-rest encryption
- **Access Control** - Role-based permissions and audit trails
- **Compliance** - GDPR, HIPAA, SOX data handling requirements
