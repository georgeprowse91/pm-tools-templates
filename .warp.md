GLOBAL RULE: Do not declare a task complete until verification is demonstrated.

Verification Protocol (required every time):
1. Run all relevant checks (tests, linters, build, `gh workflow run` + log review, etc.).
2. Show evidence:
   • Exact commands executed  
   • Exit codes  
   • Key log excerpts or summarized pass/fail counts  
   • Links/paths to artifacts (logs, reports)
3. If anything fails or is unclear, STOP and ask for guidance.
4. End with:
   === VERIFICATION SUMMARY ===
   • What was tested  
   • Results (pass/fail)  
   • Next scheduled/automatic checks (if any)

Enforcement Tips (must also be honored):
- **Checklist Parsing:** Output a Markdown checklist of required steps. Only mark items complete *after* showing evidence.  
- **CI Gate:** Reference a passing CI/build/test job (link or ID). If CI isn’t green, you may not claim completion.  
- **Diff & Logs:** Provide `git diff` (or equivalent) for changes and include trimmed logs proving success.

NEVER write “Resolved”, “Done”, or “Task complete” unless ALL the above are satisfied.
