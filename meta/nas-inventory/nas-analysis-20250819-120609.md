- Outdated technology-specific content

### Next Steps

1. **Manual Review Required:** Files marked as "Review" need individual assessment
2. **Metadata Sanitization:** All files require PII/sensitive information removal
3. **Content Updates:** Older files need currency and relevance updates
4. **Format Standardization:** Convert all templates to repository standards
