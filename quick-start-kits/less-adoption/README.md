# LeSS Adoption Roadmap

## Overview
This roadmap provides a structured approach to adopting Large-Scale Scrum (LeSS) in your organization. LeSS adoption is a significant organizational change that requires careful planning, strong leadership commitment, and systematic implementation across multiple dimensions.

## Quick Start Information
- **Framework:** LeSS (Large-Scale Scrum)
- **Adoption Timeline:** 6-18 months depending on organization size
- **Prerequisites:** Strong Scrum foundation, leadership commitment
- **Team Size:** 2-8 teams (LeSS) or 8+ teams (LeSS Huge)
- **Success Factors:** Coaching, training, and organizational commitment

## LeSS Adoption Principles

### Three Adoption Principles
1. **Deep and Narrow over Broad and Shallow**
   - Start with one product group rather than many
   - Go deep in understanding and implementation
   - Master LeSS fundamentals before expanding

2. **Top-down and Bottom-up**
   - Senior management commitment and support
   - Team-level enthusiasm and engagement
   - Middle management alignment and coaching

3. **Use Volunteers**
   - Work with willing participants initially
   - Build success stories and momentum
   - Expand based on success rather than mandate
