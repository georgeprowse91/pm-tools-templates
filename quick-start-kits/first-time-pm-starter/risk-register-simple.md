# Simple Risk Register

**Project Name:** [Project Name]  
**Project Manager:** [Your Name]  
**Date Created:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Purpose of This Document

This risk register helps you identify, assess, and manage potential problems that could affect your project. By planning for risks in advance, you can reduce their impact or prevent them entirely.

## How to Use This Template

1. **Identify Risks**: List anything that might negatively impact your project
2. **Assess Each Risk**: Rate the probability and impact (High/Medium/Low)
3. **Calculate Priority**: Use the Risk Score column to prioritize your attention
4. **Plan Responses**: Decide how to handle each risk
5. **Monitor Regularly**: Review this register weekly and update as needed

## Risk Scoring Guide

| Probability | Impact | How to Score |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| **High (3)** | **High (3)** | Probability × Impact = Risk Score |
| **Medium (2)** | **Medium (2)** | Example: Medium (2) × High (3) = 6 |
| **Low (1)** | **Low (1)** | Higher score = Higher priority |

**Priority Levels**:
- **Critical (7-9)**: Immediate attention required
- **High (5-6)**: Actively manage
- **Medium (3-4)**: Monitor regularly
- **Low (1-2)**: Keep on watchlist

## Common Risk Categories

- **Resource Risks**: Team availability, skills, turnover
- **Technical Risks**: Technology limitations, integration issues, performance
- **Schedule Risks**: Delays, dependencies, timeline constraints
- **Scope Risks**: Unclear requirements, scope creep, changes
- **Financial Risks**: Budget constraints, cost overruns, funding issues
- **External Risks**: Vendors, regulatory changes, market conditions
- **Stakeholder Risks**: Buy-in, communication, changing priorities
- **Quality Risks**: Testing limitations, standards compliance

## Response Strategies

- **Avoid**: Eliminate the threat entirely (e.g., remove risky feature)
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact (e.g., add extra testing)
- **Transfer**: Shift impact to third party (e.g., insurance, warranties)
- **Accept**: Acknowledge but take no action (for low risks or unavoidable risks)
- **Control**: Implement monitoring and management plan (e.g., regular reviews)

## Risk Status Options

- **Active**: Currently being monitored and managed
- **Closed**: No longer a threat (resolved or expired)
- **Occurred**: Risk has happened and is now an issue
- **Watchlist**: Low priority but still monitored

## Sample Risk Descriptions

| Risk Area | Example Risk Statements |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| **Resources** | "Key developer has limited availability due to other commitments" |
|  | "Team lacks experience with the required technology" |
| **Schedule** | "Dependent project is running behind schedule" |
|  | "Timeline is aggressive with limited buffer for delays" |
| **Technical** | "New technology hasn't been tested in our environment" |
|  | "Integration between systems might be more complex than estimated" |
| **Stakeholders** | "Key decision maker is often unavailable" |
|  | "Multiple stakeholders have conflicting priorities" |

## Weekly Risk Review Questions

Review your risk register weekly by asking these questions:

1. Have any risks occurred or changed in probability/impact?
2. Are mitigation plans on track?
3. Have any new risks emerged?
4. Can any risks be closed?
5. Are risk owners actively managing their assigned risks?

## Risk Management Tips for New Project Managers

1. **Don't try to identify every possible risk** - Focus on the most important ones
2. **Review risks regularly** - Set a weekly calendar reminder
3. **Involve your team** - They'll see risks you might miss
4. **Be honest about risks** - Don't downplay serious concerns
5. **Update as you go** - A risk register is a living document
6. **Communicate risks early** - Give stakeholders time to prepare
7. **Learn from past projects** - Ask colleagues about risks they've encountered

*Remember: Identifying risks is not negative thinking - it's good planning. The goal isn't to eliminate all risks (impossible) but to be prepared.*
