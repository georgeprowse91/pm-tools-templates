## 🚫 Common Transformation Mistakes

### ❌ Don't Do This
- **Skipping training** - Teams need education before implementation
- **Forcing adoption** - Change requires buy-in, not mandates
- **Copying other organizations** - Adapt practices to your context
- **Ignoring culture** - Process change without cultural change fails
- **Measuring wrong things** - Focus on outcomes, not activities

### ✅ Do This Instead
- **Invest in training** - Educate before you implement
- **Start small and learn** - Pilot before scaling
<a id="implementation-checklist"></a>
- **Adapt to your context** - Don't blindly follow frameworks
- **Address culture explicitly** - Change hearts and minds
- **Measure business value** - Focus on customer and business outcomes
