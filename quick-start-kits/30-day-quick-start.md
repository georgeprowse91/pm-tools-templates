## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

2. **Skipping stakeholder engagement** - Invest heavily in relationships early
3. **Over-documenting initially** - Start simple, add complexity gradually  
4. **Ignoring team dynamics** - Address relationship issues immediately
5. **Poor communication** - Over-communicate rather than under-communicate
6. **Not celebrating early wins** - Recognize progress to build momentum
