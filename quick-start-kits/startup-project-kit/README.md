## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Building Before Validating**: Don't start coding without customer validation
2. **Falling in Love with Your Solution**: Stay objective about customer feedback
3. **Analysis Paralysis**: Set time limits for validation phases
4. **Ignoring Negative Feedback**: Embrace criticism as learning opportunities
5. **Scaling Too Early**: Ensure product-market fit before aggressive growth
6. **Vanity Metrics Focus**: Track metrics that predict business success
7. **Skipping Financial Modeling**: Understand unit economics from the start
