## Purpose and Overview

The Stakeholder Register is a project document that identifies and categorizes individuals, groups, or organizations that could impact or be impacted by project decisions, activities, or outcomes. This document serves as a central repository of stakeholder information that helps the project team understand stakeholder relationships, influence, interests, expectations, and appropriate engagement strategies.

This register should be:
- Created during project initiation and regularly updated throughout the project lifecycle
- Used to guide stakeholder communication and engagement planning
- Maintained as confidential when containing sensitive information about stakeholders
- Referenced when making key project decisions to consider stakeholder impacts
