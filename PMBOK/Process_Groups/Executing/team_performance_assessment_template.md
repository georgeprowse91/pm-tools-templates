## Purpose and Overview

The Team Performance Assessment is a structured evaluation of individual and collective team performance. It serves to identify strengths, areas for improvement, and development opportunities that will enhance project execution and team effectiveness. Regular assessments help the project manager develop team skills, address performance issues, and improve overall project delivery capabilities.

This document aims to:
- Evaluate individual and team performance against established criteria
- Identify skill gaps and development needs
- Track progress toward performance goals
- Provide data-driven insights to enhance team effectiveness
- Document improvement plans and actions taken
- Recognize achievements and successes

## Instructions for Use

1. **Timing**: Conduct assessments at regular intervals (monthly/quarterly) and after significant project milestones
2. **Preparation**: Gather performance data, update skills matrices, and review previous assessments before meeting
3. **Process**: Involve team members in the assessment through self-evaluation and peer feedback
4. **Review**: Discuss the assessment with individual team members and as a team
5. **Action Planning**: Collaboratively develop improvement plans based on assessment results
6. **Follow-up**: Monitor progress on action items and development goals
7. **Integration**: Use insights to inform team development, resource planning, and recognition programs
