Summary: Terminology alignment and canonical link updates

- Align user-facing terminology from “PMBOK” to “Traditional” across primary documentation.
  - Updated templates/README.md, templates/hybrid/Hybrid/README.md, industry-specializations/README.md, templates/traditional/Traditional/README.md, methodology-frameworks/README.md, and examples/README.md.
  - Preserved legal/trademark statements and authoritative standards citations (e.g., PMBOK® section references), and skipped generated site output.
- Updated README “Most Popular Templates” to use canonical paths under templates/ and role-based-toolkits.
- Began deduplication of TEMPLATE_INDEX.md by adding a canonicalization note and retargeting duplicate rows to canonical templates paths.
- Ran repository link checks for README files; no broken links detected.

Notes:
- Future work will continue consolidating duplicate index entries and normalizing naming conventions.
- See CONTRIBUTING.md (Terminology and Standards References) for guidance on when to use “Traditional” vs. PMBOK® citations.
