### Template Standards
- **Format:** All templates in Markdown with consistent headers
- **Metadata:** Purpose, audience, methodology, complexity specified
- **Usage guidance:** When to use, how it fits lifecycle, related templates
- **Integration info:** Tool export/import, automation opportunities

### Migration Approach
- **No content deletion:** All existing templates preserved during migration
- **Gradual transition:** Old structure maintained until migration complete
- **Link updates:** Internal references updated progressively
- **User communication:** Clear navigation during transition period
