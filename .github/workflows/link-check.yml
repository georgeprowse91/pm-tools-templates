            The automated link health check has detected a significant drop in link quality.

            ### Action Required
            1. Review the [link health report](https://github.com/${{ github.repository }}/actions/runs/${{ github.run_id }})
            2. Fix broken links according to priority
            3. Run \`./analyze-all-links.sh\` locally to verify fixes
            
            ### Priority Areas
            - Missing README.md files in existing directories
            - Broken template file references
            - Invalid external links
