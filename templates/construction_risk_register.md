## Introduction

This Construction Risk Register template is designed to identify, assess, track, and manage risks specific to construction projects. Construction projects face unique risks related to safety, site conditions, weather, regulatory compliance, resource availability, and technical complexity. This register provides a structured approach to managing these risks throughout the project lifecycle.

**Instructions:** 
1. Review all pre-populated common construction risks
2. Add project-specific risks based on your project's unique characteristics
3. Assess each risk using the provided criteria
4. Develop response strategies for all medium and high risks
5. Assign risk owners and due dates
6. Review and update the register regularly throughout the project

## Risk Assessment Criteria

### Probability Rating

| Rating | Description | Probability Range |
|--------|-------------|------------------|
| 1 | Very Low | <10% chance of occurrence |
| 2 | Low | 10-30% chance of occurrence |
| 3 | Medium | 30-50% chance of occurrence |
| 4 | High | 50-70% chance of occurrence |
| 5 | Very High | >70% chance of occurrence |

### Impact Rating

| Rating | Schedule Impact | Cost Impact | Safety Impact | Quality Impact | Reputation Impact |
|--------|----------------|------------|--------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1 | <1 week delay | <1% of budget | Minor injury, no lost time | Minor rework, no impact on functionality | Limited internal awareness |
| 2 | 1-2 week delay | 1-3% of budget | Recordable injury, no lost time | Localized rework, minimal impact on functionality | Limited external awareness |
| 3 | 2-4 week delay | 3-7% of budget | Lost time injury | Significant rework, moderate impact on functionality | Local negative publicity |
| 4 | 1-3 month delay | 7-15% of budget | Multiple injuries or single serious injury | Major rework, significant impact on functionality | Regional negative publicity |
| 5 | >3 month delay | >15% of budget | Fatality or permanent disability | Complete replacement of elements, critical impact on functionality | National negative publicity |

### Risk Score and Priority

Risk Score = Probability Rating × Impact Rating

| Risk Score | Priority Level | Required Response |
|------------|---------------|-------------------|
| 1-4 | Low | Monitor and review periodically |
| 5-10 | Medium | Develop risk response strategies and contingency plans |
| 11-15 | High | Implement detailed risk response plan with regular monitoring |
| 16-25 | Very High | Immediate action required, senior management involvement |

## Risk Response Strategies

1. **Avoid**: Eliminate the threat by eliminating the cause
   - *Example*: Relocate building footprint to avoid contaminated soil area

2. **Transfer**: Shift the impact and ownership of the risk to a third party
   - *Example*: Purchase specific insurance policies, use fixed-price contracts

3. **Mitigate**: Reduce the probability and/or impact of the risk
   - *Example*: Conduct additional soil testing, implement enhanced safety protocols

4. **Accept**: Acknowledge the risk and take no proactive action
   - *Example*: Include contingency in schedule/budget for normal weather delays

5. **Contingent Response**: Prepare action plans to be executed if the risk occurs
   - *Example*: Develop detailed dewatering plan to implement if high water table is encountered

6. **Escalate**: Pass decision-making responsibility to a higher authority
   - *Example*: Elevate major design conflicts to executive committee for resolution

- **Bi-weekly**: Review all active risks
- **Monthly**: Comprehensive review of entire risk register
- **Quarterly**: Strategic risk review with senior management
- **Milestone-based**: Review before starting each major phase

### Risk Auditing Process
1. Verify that risk response actions are being implemented
2. Assess effectiveness of risk responses
3. Identify new risks that have emerged
4. Update risk assessments based on current conditions
5. Document lessons learned for future projects

### Risk Communication Protocol

## Risk Register Usage Guidelines

### Early Project Stage
- Focus on site condition risks, permit risks, and design risks
- Conduct risk identification workshops with all key team members
- Establish initial risk response plans for high-priority risks
- Incorporate risk contingency into initial budgets and schedules

### Mid-Project Stage
- Shift focus to procurement, construction execution, and quality risks
- Update probabilities based on actual performance
- Implement planned risk responses
- Identify new risks from change orders and field conditions

### Late Project Stage
- Focus on commissioning, closeout, and warranty risks
- Document risk outcomes for lessons learned
- Transfer appropriate information to operations team
- Prepare final risk report documenting risk management effectiveness
