# Program Work Breakdown Structure (PWBS)

Hierarchical decomposition of program deliverables and work across projects.

Structure
- Level 1: Program Capability/Outcome Areas
- Level 2: Projects/Workstreams
- Level 3: Major Deliverables
- Level 4+: Work Packages

Guidance
- Keep WBS deliverable-oriented
- Map deliverables to benefits and KPIs
- Tie WBS to schedule and risk register
