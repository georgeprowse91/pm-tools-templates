## 6. Risk Response Planning

### 6.1 Response Strategies
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the threat by eliminating the cause
- **Transfer**: Shift the impact of the threat to a third party
- **Mitigate**: Reduce the probability or impact of the threat
- **Accept**: Acknowledge the risk without taking any action (for low risks)
- **Escalate**: Raise the risk to a higher level of management for decision

### 6.2 Implementation Requirements
For each risk response strategy:
- Clearly define specific actions
- Assign responsible parties
- Establish timeline for implementation
- Identify resource requirements
- Define success criteria and effectiveness measures

| High | Biweekly | Senior Management |
| Medium | Monthly | Project Management |
| Low | Quarterly | Team Level |
| Very Low | Biannually | Team Level |

### 7.2 Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
