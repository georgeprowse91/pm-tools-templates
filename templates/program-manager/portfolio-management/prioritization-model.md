## 📊 Portfolio Prioritization Results

### Overall Priority Score Calculation

| Program/Initiative | Strategic Alignment <br>(Weight: 30%) | Business Value <br>(Weight: 25%) | Cost/Effort <br>(Weight: 15%) | Risk <br>(Weight: 15%) | Customer Impact <br>(Weight: 15%) | Total Priority Score | Rank |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|------|
| [Program 1] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Calculated] | [#] |
| [Program 2] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Calculated] | [#] |
| [Program 3] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Calculated] | [#] |
| [Program 4] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Calculated] | [#] |
| [Program 5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Score 1-5] | [Calculated] | [#] |

**Calculation Method:**
```
Total Priority Score = (Strategic Alignment Score × 30%) + (Business Value Score × 25%) 
                      + (Cost/Effort Score × 15%) + (Risk Score × 15%) + (Customer Impact × 15%)
```

### Scoring Criteria

**Strategic Alignment (Weight: 30%)**
- **5**: Directly enables strategic objective with measurable outcomes
- **4**: Strongly supports strategic objective with clear benefits
- **3**: Moderately aligned with strategic objectives
- **2**: Indirectly supports strategic objectives
- **1**: Minimal alignment with strategic objectives

**Business Value (Weight: 25%)**
- **5**: Very high ROI/NPV (>20% IRR or >$5M NPV)
- **4**: High value (15-20% IRR or $2-5M NPV)
- **3**: Moderate value (10-15% IRR or $1-2M NPV)
- **2**: Low value (5-10% IRR or $500K-1M NPV)
- **1**: Minimal value (<5% IRR or <$500K NPV)

**Cost/Effort (Weight: 15%) - Inverted Scale**
- **5**: Very low cost/effort (<$500K, <6 months)
- **4**: Low cost/effort ($500K-1M, 6-12 months)
- **3**: Moderate cost/effort ($1-3M, 12-18 months)
- **2**: High cost/effort ($3-5M, 18-24 months)
- **1**: Very high cost/effort (>$5M, >24 months)

**Risk (Weight: 15%) - Inverted Scale**
- **5**: Very low risk (proven approach, low complexity)
- **4**: Low risk (some unknowns, manageable complexity)
- **3**: Moderate risk (several dependencies, medium complexity)
- **2**: High risk (many unknowns, high complexity)
- **1**: Very high risk (unproven approach, very high complexity)

**Customer Impact (Weight: 15%)**
- **5**: Significant positive impact on customer experience/satisfaction
- **4**: Notable improvement in customer experience
- **3**: Moderate customer benefit
- **2**: Minor customer impact
- **1**: Minimal or no direct customer benefit

### Decision Rules

**Approval Thresholds:**
- **Automatic Approval**: Priority Score > 4.0 and within allocated budget
- **Portfolio Review Required**: Priority Score 3.0-4.0 or exceeds budget by <20%
- **Executive Review Required**: Priority Score < 3.0 or exceeds budget by >20%

**Investment Constraints:**
- Maximum 30% of portfolio budget allocated to high-risk initiatives (Risk Score < 3)
- Minimum 60% of portfolio aligned to top strategic themes
- Maximum 25% of resources allocated to single program/initiative

### Portfolio Balancing

| Category | Current Allocation | Target Allocation | Variance |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Run (Operational)** | [X%] | 40% | [Z%] |
| **Grow (Enhancement)** | [X%] | 35% | [Z%] |
| **Transform (Innovation)** | [X%] | 25% | [Z%] |
| **Total** | 100% | 100% | |
