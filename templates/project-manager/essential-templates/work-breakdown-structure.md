# Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) Template

## WBS Overview

### Project Information

### WBS Purpose
The Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables.

### WBS Principles
- **100% Rule**: The WBS includes 100% of the work defined by the project scope
- **Mutually Exclusive**: Each WBS element is distinct with no overlap
- **Outcome Oriented**: Focused on deliverables, not activities
- **Hierarchical**: Organized in levels from general to specific
