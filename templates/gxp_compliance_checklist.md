## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This GxP Compliance Checklist provides a comprehensive framework for assessing compliance with applicable Good Practice (GxP) requirements for [Project/Product Name]. It serves as a tool to identify compliance gaps, prioritize remediation efforts, and document compliance status throughout the project lifecycle.

### 1.2 Scope
This checklist covers the following GxP areas as applicable to [Project/Product Name]:
- Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
- Good Clinical Practice (GCP)
- Good Laboratory Practice (GLP)
- Good Documentation Practice (GDocP)
- Good Distribution Practice (GDP)
- Good Pharmacovigilance Practice (GVP)
- Good Data Integrity Practice

### 1.3 How to Use This Checklist
1. Determine which GxP areas apply to your project/product
2. Complete the applicable sections of the checklist
3. For each requirement, assess compliance status and document evidence
4. Identify gaps and develop remediation plans
5. Track progress toward full compliance
6. Update the checklist periodically as the project progresses

### 1.4 Compliance Status Definitions

| Status | Symbol | Definition |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Compliant | ✓ | Requirement is fully met with appropriate evidence |
| Partially Compliant | ⚠️ | Requirement is partially met; gaps exist that need addressing |
| Non-Compliant | ✗ | Requirement is not met |
| Not Applicable | N/A | Requirement does not apply to this project/product |
| Not Started | — | Assessment not yet conducted |

## 2. GxP Assessment Framework

### 2.1 Assessment Methodology
Each GxP requirement should be assessed using the following approach:

1. **Requirement Understanding**: Clearly understand what the requirement entails
2. **Evidence Collection**: Gather documentation and other evidence
3. **Gap Analysis**: Identify any gaps between current state and required state
4. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate the risk associated with any identified gaps
5. **Remediation Planning**: Develop actions to address gaps
6. **Verification**: Confirm that remediation actions have been effective

### 2.2 Evidence Requirements
Acceptable evidence to demonstrate compliance may include:

- Approved policies and procedures
- Completed forms and records
- Training documentation
- Validation reports
- Audit reports
- Monitoring records
- Testing results
- Regulatory correspondence
- Third-party certifications

### 2.3 Common Gap Categories

| Category | Description | Common Remediation Approaches |
|----------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| Documentation | Missing, incomplete, or outdated documentation | Develop/update documentation according to templates; implement document control system |
| Training | Insufficient training or training records | Conduct training needs assessment; develop training materials; document training |
| Processes | Undefined or inadequate processes | Process mapping; SOP development; workflow optimization |
| Technology | Systems not validated or compliant | System assessment; validation; implementation of controls |
| Oversight | Inadequate monitoring or management | Implement review processes; establish metrics; strengthen governance |
| Resources | Insufficient personnel or expertise | Resource planning; training; external expertise engagement |
