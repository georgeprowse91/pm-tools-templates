# SAFe Portfolio Kanban Template

**Enterprise:** [Enterprise Name]  
**Portfolio:** [Portfolio Name]  
**Created By:** [Name/Role]  
**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Version:** [1.0]

## 📋 Portfolio Kanban Overview

The Portfolio Kanban system visualizes the flow of business and enabler epics from concept to completion, helping to:

- Limit work in progress (WIP) to improve flow
- Make portfolio work visible to all stakeholders
- Establish clear policies for work movement
- Implement a structured approach to portfolio prioritization
- Provide transparency into the enterprise's most significant initiatives

This template provides a framework for implementing a SAFe Portfolio Kanban system following Scaled Agile Framework best practices.

## 🔄 Kanban Board Structure

### Epic Workflow States

## 🔄 Portfolio Kanban Policies

### General Policies
1. **Card Movement:** Only move cards during Portfolio Sync meetings or with LPM approval
2. **WIP Limits:** Only exceed WIP limits with explicit approval from Portfolio Management
3. **Age Monitoring:** Epics in any state for more than 30 days require escalation and review
4. **Blockers:** Blocked epics must be clearly marked and discussed in Portfolio Sync
5. **Prioritization:** WSJF is the primary prioritization mechanism for epics

### State-Specific Policies

#### Funnel Policies
- New epics can be added by anyone in the organization
- Each epic requires a brief description and identified sponsor
- Funnel is reviewed and groomed monthly
- Epics without activity for 90+ days may be removed

#### Reviewing Policies
- Epic review occurs weekly during Portfolio Sync
- Initial WSJF calculation must be completed before advancing
- Business and enabler epics must align with at least one strategic theme
- Maximum time in state: 4 weeks

#### Analyzing Policies
- Analysis requires involvement of subject matter experts from relevant areas
- Lean business case must include benefits hypothesis and success metrics
- Architectural and UX conceptual designs must be completed
- Maximum time in state: 8 weeks

#### Portfolio Backlog Policies
- Epics must be sequenced based on WSJF and dependencies
- Epics can only be pulled when implementation capacity is available
- Quarterly review of backlog to ensure continued strategic alignment
- Epic details and documentation must be current before implementation

#### Implementing Policies
- Implementation must be coordinated across affected ARTs
- Status must be updated at least bi-weekly
- Impediments must be raised to Portfolio Sync meetings
- Significant scope changes require re-analysis and approval

#### Done/Archived Policies
- Benefit measurement plan must be in place for at least 3 months post-completion
- Retrospective must be conducted and documented
- All documentation must be finalized and stored in knowledge repository

## 💹 WSJF Calculation

Weighted Shortest Job First (WSJF) is calculated as:

**WSJF = Cost of Delay ÷ Job Size**

Where **Cost of Delay** = (Business Value + Time Criticality + Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement)

### Scoring Guidelines

| Score | Business Value | Time Criticality | Risk Reduction | Job Size |
|-------|---------------|------------------|----------------|----------|
| **1** | Minimal value | No urgency | Minimal risk reduction | Extra Large |
| **3** | Moderate value | Low urgency | Some risk reduction | Large |
| **5** | Significant value | Moderate urgency | Significant risk reduction | Medium |
| **8** | High value | High urgency | Substantial risk reduction | Small |
| **13** | Very high value | Very high urgency | Very high risk reduction | Extra Small |
| **20** | Extreme value | Extreme urgency | Major risk reduction | - |

### WSJF Example

| Epic | Business Value | Time Criticality | Risk Reduction | CoD (Sum) | Job Size | WSJF (CoD ÷ Job Size) | Rank |
|------|---------------|------------------|----------------|-----------|----------|----------------------|------|
| Customer Portal | 13 | 8 | 5 | 26 | 5 | 5.2 | 2 |
| Payment Gateway | 20 | 13 | 8 | 41 | 8 | 5.1 | 3 |
| Data Migration | 8 | 20 | 13 | 41 | 3 | 13.7 | 1 |
| UX Redesign | 13 | 5 | 5 | 23 | 8 | 2.9 | 5 |
| Security Update | 8 | 13 | 20 | 41 | 13 | 3.2 | 4 |

## 🔄 Portfolio Kanban Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Description | Solution |
|--------------|-------------|----------|
| **Kanban Theater** | Following the form but not the principles | Focus on flow, limiting WIP, and making policies explicit |
| **WIP Limit Violations** | Regularly exceeding WIP limits | Enforce limits, escalate violations, address root causes |
| **Stale Epics** | Epics staying in one state for extended periods | Implement aging policies, regular review of aged items |
| **Bypassing Process** | Moving epics without meeting exit criteria | Reinforce policies, require formal approval for exceptions |
| **Micro-portfolio Management** | Portfolio team making all decisions | Empower ARTs/teams, focus portfolio on strategic decisions |
| **Focusing on Activity, Not Outcomes** | Measuring busyness instead of value | Shift metrics to outcomes, measure benefits realization |
