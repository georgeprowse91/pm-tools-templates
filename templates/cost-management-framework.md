# Cost Management Framework

## Template Overview
A comprehensive framework for managing project and organizational costs throughout the lifecycle, providing structure for cost planning, monitoring, controlling, and optimization across methodologies.

## Framework Components

### 1. Cost Planning Structure

#### Cost Categories
```
Direct Costs:
- Personnel (internal and external)
- Equipment and technology
- Materials and supplies
- Travel and training
- Third-party services

Indirect Costs:
- Overhead allocation
- Administrative support
- Facility costs
- Shared resources
- Management oversight

Fixed vs. Variable Costs:
- Fixed: Infrastructure, licenses, base salaries
- Variable: Usage-based services, overtime, materials
```

#### Cost Estimation Methods
- **Analogous Estimating**: Based on historical similar projects
- **Parametric Estimating**: Using statistical relationships
- **Bottom-up Estimating**: Detailed work package estimates
- **Three-point Estimating**: Optimistic, pessimistic, most likely
- **Reserve Analysis**: Contingency and management reserves

### 2. Cost Baseline Development

#### Baseline Components
```
Time-phased Budget:
- Period: [Quarter/Month]
- Planned Cost: $[Amount]
- Cumulative: $[Running Total]
- Work Performance: [% Complete]
- Variance Threshold: [±%]

Cost Breakdown Structure (CBS):
Level 1: Project/Program
├── Level 2: Major Components
│   ├── Level 3: Work Packages
│   │   └── Level 4: Activities
│   └── Cost Accounts
└── Control Accounts
```

### 3. Cost Monitoring & Control

#### Key Performance Indicators
```
Cost Performance Metrics:
- Cost Performance Index (CPI): EV/AC
- Schedule Performance Index (SPI): EV/PV
- Cost Variance (CV): EV - AC
- Schedule Variance (SV): EV - PV
- Estimate at Completion (EAC)
- Estimate to Complete (ETC)
- Variance at Completion (VAC)

Threshold Indicators:
- Green: Variance ≤ 5%
- Yellow: Variance 5-10%
- Red: Variance > 10%
```

#### Control Mechanisms
- **Budget Reviews**: Weekly/monthly variance analysis
- **Change Control**: Cost impact assessment for all changes
- **Earned Value Management**: Integrated performance measurement
- **Forecasting**: Regular EAC updates and trend analysis
- **Corrective Actions**: Immediate response to variances

### 4. Cost Optimization Strategies

#### Value Engineering
```
Analysis Framework:
1. Function Analysis
   - What does it do?
   - What must it do?
   - What should it cost?

2. Alternative Generation
   - Brainstorm alternatives
   - Creative problem solving
   - Technology alternatives

3. Evaluation Criteria
   - Cost reduction potential
   - Risk assessment
   - Quality impact
   - Schedule implications

4. Implementation Planning
   - Resource requirements
   - Timeline
   - Success metrics
```

#### Cost Reduction Techniques
- **Scope Optimization**: Remove non-essential features
- **Resource Optimization**: Skill-cost matching
- **Process Improvement**: Eliminate waste and rework
- **Vendor Negotiation**: Better rates and terms
- **Technology Leverage**: Automation and efficiency

### 5. Financial Governance Controls

#### Approval Authority Matrix
```
Cost Category | < $10K | $10K-$50K | $50K-$100K | > $100K
Personnel     | PM     | PM + Dir   | Dir + VP   | VP + CFO
Equipment     | PM     | Director   | VP + CFO   | Board
Services      | PM     | PM + Dir   | Dir + VP   | VP + CFO
Changes       | PM     | Director   | VP         | CFO
```

#### Procurement Controls
- **Competitive Bidding**: Minimum vendor requirements
- **Contract Types**: Fixed-price vs. cost-reimbursable
- **Payment Terms**: Milestone-based payments
- **Performance Bonds**: Risk mitigation measures
- **Audit Rights**: Financial transparency requirements

### 6. Reporting & Communication

#### Financial Reports
```
Executive Dashboard:
- Budget vs. Actual: $[Amount] ([±%])
- Forecast to Complete: $[EAC]
- Key Variances: [Top 3 items]
- Risk Exposure: $[Amount]
- Upcoming Decisions: [Critical items]

Detailed Cost Report:
- Work Package Performance
- Vendor/Contract Status
- Change Request Impact
- Risk Register Financial Impact
- Resource Utilization Rates
```

#### Stakeholder Communication
- **Executive Summary**: High-level financial status
- **Management Reports**: Detailed variance analysis
- **Team Updates**: Budget constraints and targets
- **Vendor Communications**: Payment and performance
- **Audit Documentation**: Compliance and transparency

### 7. Risk Management Integration

#### Cost Risk Categories
```
Technical Risks:
- Scope creep and gold-plating
- Technical complexity underestimation
- Integration challenges
- Performance requirements

External Risks:
- Market conditions and inflation
- Vendor performance and pricing
- Regulatory changes
- Currency fluctuations

Organizational Risks:
- Resource availability
- Skill gaps and learning curves
- Competing priorities
- Management support
```

#### Risk Response Strategies
- **Avoid**: Change approach to eliminate risk
- **Transfer**: Insurance, contracts, outsourcing
- **Mitigate**: Reduce probability or impact
- **Accept**: Acknowledge and monitor

### 8. Tools & Templates

#### Cost Management Tools
- **Spreadsheet Templates**: Budget tracking and analysis
- **Project Management Software**: Integrated cost tracking
- **Enterprise Systems**: ERP and financial integration
- **Earned Value Tools**: Performance measurement
- **Business Intelligence**: Dashboard and reporting

#### Template Library
