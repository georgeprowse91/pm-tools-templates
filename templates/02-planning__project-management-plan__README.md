## 🔄 Integration Strategies

### Horizontal Integration (Across Knowledge Areas)
**Scope-Schedule-Cost Integration:**

- Schedule influences resource needs and costs
- Cost constraints may require scope adjustments
- All three form the "triple constraint" baseline

**Quality-Risk Integration:**
<a id="vertical-integration-across-project-levels"></a>
- Quality requirements influence risk assessment
- Risk responses may require quality trade-offs
- Quality planning includes risk mitigation
- Both require ongoing monitoring and control

**Communication-Stakeholder Integration:**
- Stakeholder analysis drives communication planning
- Communication effectiveness impacts stakeholder engagement
- Both require regular review and adaptation
- Integration ensures consistent messaging

### Vertical Integration (Across Project Levels)
<a id="temporal-integration-across-project-phases"></a>
**Strategic-Tactical Integration:**
- Business case alignment with tactical plans
- Portfolio priorities influencing project planning
- Resource allocation across multiple projects
- Strategic metrics reflected in project measures

**Plan-Execution Integration:**
- Planning assumptions validated during execution
<a id="approval-baseline-process"></a>
- Execution learnings feed back into planning
<a id="1-plan-development-week-2-3-of-planning"></a>
- Regular plan updates based on actual performance
- Baseline management and change control

### Temporal Integration (Across Project Phases)
**Phase Gate Integration:**
- Planning deliverables feed execution phase
- Execution results inform monitoring processes
- Control actions may require plan updates
- Closure lessons learned improve future planning

## ⚠️ Common Planning Pitfalls

### Planning Too Much Detail Too Early
❌ **Avoid:** Creating detailed 2-year schedules in week 1
✅ **Instead:** Use progressive elaboration - detail near-term, high-level long-term
<a id="plan-quality-assessment"></a>

### Planning in Isolation
❌ **Avoid:** PM creating plan without team and stakeholder input
✅ **Instead:** Collaborative planning with key team members and stakeholders

### Over-Planning or Under-Planning
❌ **Avoid:** Either 200-page plans or 2-page plans for complex projects
✅ **Instead:** Match planning detail to project complexity and risk

### Ignoring Organizational Context
❌ **Avoid:** Using generic templates without organizational customization
✅ **Instead:** Adapt plans to organizational culture, processes, and standards

### Static Planning Mindset
❌ **Avoid:** Treating approved plan as unchangeable
✅ **Instead:** Build in regular review and update cycles
