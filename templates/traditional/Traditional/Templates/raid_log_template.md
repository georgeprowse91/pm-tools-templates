## Overview

The RAID Log is a consolidated project management tool that tracks four critical project elements:

- **Assumptions** - Things we believe to be true but haven't verified
- **Issues** - Current problems that need immediate attention
- **Dependencies** - External factors the project relies on

## How to Use This Log

1. **Review weekly** during team meetings or status reviews
2. **Assign owners** for each item to ensure accountability
3. **Update status** regularly and close items when resolved
4. **Escalate** high-priority items to project sponsor/steering committee
5. **Archive** closed items for lessons learned
