|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Very High | Almost certain to occur | 81-100% |
| High | Likely to occur | 61-80% |
| Medium | May occur | 41-60% |
| Low | Unlikely to occur | 21-40% |
| Very Low | Rare, but possible | 1-20% |

### 3.2 Impact Scale
| Level | Cost Impact | Schedule Impact | Quality Impact | Scope Impact |
|-------|-------------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Very High | >20% increase | >20% delay | Major degradation | Major scope reduction |
| High | 10-20% increase | 10-20% delay | Significant degradation | Significant scope reduction |
| Medium | 5-10% increase | 5-10% delay | Moderate degradation | Moderate scope reduction |
| Low | 1-5% increase | 1-5% delay | Minor degradation | Minor scope reduction |
| Very Low | <1% increase | <1% delay | Negligible impact | Negligible impact |

### 3.3 Risk Scoring Matrix
| Probability \ Impact | Very Low | Low | Medium | High | Very High |
|---------------------|----------|-----|--------|------|-----------|
| **Very High** | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 |
| **High** | 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 20 |
| **Medium** | 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 |
| **Low** | 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 |

### 4.2 Positive Risk (Opportunity) Responses
- **Exploit**: Ensure the opportunity is realized
- **Enhance**: Increase probability or positive impact
- **Share**: Allocate ownership to third party best able to capture opportunity
- **Accept**: Take advantage if opportunity occurs

### 4.3 Response Planning Criteria
| Risk Level | Response Required | Timeline | Authority |
|------------|-------------------|----------|-----------|
