- Validate plans with subject matter experts

### Unrealistic Estimates
**Problem:** Overly optimistic time and resource projections
**Mitigation:**
- Use multiple estimation techniques for validation
- Include appropriate contingency and buffer time
- Consider resource availability and skill constraints
- Validate estimates with historical data and experience

### Poor Stakeholder Engagement
**Problem:** Plans developed without adequate stakeholder input
**Solutions:**
- Conduct comprehensive stakeholder analysis
- Include stakeholders in planning activities and reviews
