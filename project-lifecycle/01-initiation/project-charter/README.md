## ⚠️ Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Too Much Detail Too Early
❌ **Avoid:** Writing a 20-page charter with detailed requirements
✅ **Instead:** Keep it high-level, use charter to authorize further planning

### Missing Success Criteria
❌ **Avoid:** Vague statements like "improve customer satisfaction"
✅ **Instead:** Specific, measurable criteria like "increase NPS by 15 points"

### Unclear Authority
❌ **Avoid:** Generic PM authority statements
✅ **Instead:** Specific decision-making power and resource access

### No Stakeholder Engagement
❌ **Avoid:** Writing charter in isolation
✅ **Instead:** Collaborate with sponsor and key stakeholders throughout

### Wrong Template for Project Type
❌ **Avoid:** Using traditional charter for Agile project
✅ **Instead:** Match template to methodology and project characteristics
