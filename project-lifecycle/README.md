# Project Lifecycle Templates

**Universal project templates organized by phase**

This section provides templates organized by the traditional project lifecycle phases, but designed to work across all methodologies (Traditional, Agile, and Hybrid).

<a id="how-this-section-works"></a>
## 🎨 How This Section Works

### Universal Approach
These templates are **methodology-agnostic** - they can be adapted for:
- **Traditional projects** - Use as comprehensive planning documents
- **Agile projects** - Use as lightweight, iterative guides
- **Hybrid projects** - Mix and match based on project needs

### Progressive Disclosure
Each phase builds on the previous one:
1. **Initiation** → Define the "what" and "why"
2. **Planning** → Define the "how" and "when"
3. **Execution** → Build and deliver
4. **Monitoring & Control** → Track and adjust
5. **Closure** → Complete and learn

## 💡 Pro Tips

### Template Selection
1. **Start simple** - Choose 3-5 core templates for your first project
2. **Build experience** - Add more templates as you gain confidence
3. **Customize wisely** - Adapt templates but maintain core structure

### Phase Management
1. **Don't skip initiation** - Poor starts lead to project failure
2. **Invest in planning** - 1 hour of planning saves 10 hours of execution
3. **Monitor continuously** - Small course corrections prevent big problems
4. **Close properly** - Capture lessons for future success

### Cross-Methodology
1. **Mix and match** - Use the best templates from each methodology
2. **Scale appropriately** - More risky = more structure
3. **Stay flexible** - Adapt as you learn what works

*These templates provide a foundation for any project approach. Adapt them to your organization's culture, methodology preferences, and specific project needs.*
