## 2. Risk Assessment Methodology

### 2.1 Risk Management Process

The compliance risk assessment follows the ICH Q9 risk management process:
1. Risk Identification
2. Risk Analysis
3. Risk Evaluation
4. Risk Control
5. Risk Review
6. Risk Communication

![Risk Management Process Diagram]

### 2.2 Risk Assessment Team

The risk assessment should be performed by a cross-functional team with representatives from:
- Quality Assurance
- Regulatory Affairs
- Operations/Manufacturing
- Validation
- Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) for the specific area being assessed
- Compliance/Legal (as needed)
- IT/Data Management (for data integrity assessments)

### 2.3 Risk Assessment Approach

This template uses a systematic approach to risk assessment:

1. **Identify Compliance Requirements**: Document all applicable regulatory requirements, standards, and internal policies relevant to the process/system under assessment.

2. **Identify Potential Compliance Risks**: Through brainstorming, process analysis, historical data review, and audit findings, identify potential risks.

3. **Analyze and Evaluate Risks**: Determine the severity, likelihood, and detectability of each risk to calculate an overall risk priority number (RPN).

4. **Develop Risk Mitigation Plans**: For unacceptable risks, identify actions to eliminate, reduce, or control the risk.

5. **Implement and Verify Controls**: Implement risk control measures and verify their effectiveness.

6. **Review and Monitor**: Establish an ongoing monitoring process to ensure continued compliance.

### 4.2 Impact/Severity Levels

| Level | Rating | Description | Examples |
|-------|--------|-------------|----------|
| 5 | Critical | Direct impact on patient safety; potential for serious injury or death; severe regulatory action (license suspension, consent decree); significant financial penalties (>$1M) | Adulterated product released to market; Falsification of critical data |
| 4 | Major | Potential indirect impact on patient safety; significant impact on product quality; regulatory warning letter; moderate financial penalties ($250K-$1M) | Major GMP deviations; significant data integrity issues |
| 3 | Moderate | Limited impact on product quality; regulatory observations (483, inspection findings); limited financial impact ($50K-$250K) | Documentation deficiencies; minor process deviations |
| 2 | Minor | No impact on product quality; minor regulatory observations; minimal financial impact (<$50K) | Procedural errors with adequate controls; minor documentation issues |
| 1 | Negligible | No impact on regulatory compliance, product quality or patient safety; no financial impact | Administrative issues; improvement opportunities |

### 4.3 Probability/Likelihood Levels

| Level | Rating | Qualitative Description | Frequency-Based Description |
|-------|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| 5 | Almost Certain | Expected to occur in most circumstances | More than once per month or >80% probability |
| 4 | Likely | Will probably occur in most circumstances | Once per 1-6 months or 60-80% probability |
| 3 | Possible | Might occur at some time | Once per 6-12 months or 40-60% probability |
| 2 | Unlikely | Could occur at some time but not expected | Once per 1-5 years or 20-40% probability |
| 1 | Rare | May occur only in exceptional circumstances | Less than once per 5 years or <20% probability |

### 4.4 Detectability Levels (Optional)

| Level | Rating | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 5 | Undetectable | Controls will not detect the risk or no controls exist |
| 4 | Poor Detection | Controls have low probability of detecting the risk |
| 3 | Moderate Detection | Controls might detect the risk |
| 2 | Good Detection | Controls will likely detect the risk |
| 1 | Certain Detection | Controls will almost certainly detect the risk |

### 4.5 Risk Scoring Method

#### 4.5.1 Risk Priority Number (RPN) Method

RPN = Severity × Probability × Detectability

Risk Acceptability:
- High Risk (RPN > 40): Unacceptable, requires immediate mitigation
- Medium Risk (RPN 20-40): Requires mitigation with defined timeline
- Low Risk (RPN < 20): Acceptable with routine monitoring

#### 4.5.2 Risk Matrix Method (Alternate)

Using a 5×5 matrix of Severity vs. Probability:

![Risk Matrix]

Risk Levels:
- Critical (Red): Immediate action required
- High (Orange): Action required with defined timeline
- Medium (Yellow): Action should be planned
- Low (Green): No immediate action required, routine monitoring
