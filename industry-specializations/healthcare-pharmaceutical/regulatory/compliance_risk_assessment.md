## 1. Risk Assessment Overview and Methodology

### 1.1 Purpose and Scope
This document provides a structured framework for identifying, evaluating, and mitigating compliance risks associated with [PRODUCT/PROCESS NAME]. The assessment covers regulatory compliance requirements applicable to pharmaceutical development, manufacturing, and commercialization activities.

### 1.2 Risk Assessment Methodology
This assessment follows the principles of ICH Q9 (Quality Risk Management) and uses a systematic approach to evaluate compliance risks:

#### 1.2.1 Risk Assessment Process
1. **Risk Identification**: Systematic identification of potential risks to compliance
2. **Risk Analysis**: Evaluation of identified risks using defined criteria for:
   - Severity (S): Impact of risk if it occurs
   - Probability (P): Likelihood of risk occurrence
   - Detectability (D): Ability to detect risk before impact
3. **Risk Evaluation**: Calculation of Risk Priority Number (RPN) as S × P × D
4. **Risk Control**: Development of mitigation strategies for prioritized risks
5. **Risk Review**: Ongoing monitoring and reassessment of risks
