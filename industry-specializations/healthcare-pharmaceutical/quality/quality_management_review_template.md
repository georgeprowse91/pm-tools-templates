## Review Components

### Quality Objectives and KPIs

#### Strategic Quality Objectives

| Strategic Objective | Target | Current Performance | Trend | Status |
|---------------------|--------|---------------------|-------|--------|
| [Objective 1] | [Target] | [Performance] | [↑/↓/→] | [Met/Not Met] |
| [Objective 2] | [Target] | [Performance] | [↑/↓/→] | [Met/Not Met] |
| [Objective 3] | [Target] | [Performance] | [↑/↓/→] | [Met/Not Met] |

#### Operational Quality KPIs

| KPI Category | Metric | Target | Current Period | Previous Period | Trend | Status |
|--------------|--------|--------|----------------|----------------|-------|--------|
| **Manufacturing** | Right First Time (RFT) | ≥95% | [Value]% | [Value]% | [↑/↓/→] | [Color] |
| | Batch Rejection Rate | ≤1% | [Value]% | [Value]% | [↑/↓/→] | [Color] |
| | Deviation Rate per Batch | ≤1.5 | [Value] | [Value] | [↑/↓/→] | [Color] |
| **Laboratory** | OOS Rate | ≤0.5% | [Value]% | [Value]% | [↑/↓/→] | [Color] |
| | Lab Investigation Cycle Time | ≤15 days | [Value] days | [Value] days | [↑/↓/→] | [Color] |
| | Method Transfer Success Rate | ≥90% | [Value]% | [Value]% | [↑/↓/→] | [Color] |
| **Quality Systems** | CAPA On-Time Closure | ≥90% | [Value]% | [Value]% | [↑/↓/→] | [Color] |
| | Change Control Cycle Time | ≤60 days | [Value] days | [Value] days | [↑/↓/→] | [Color] |
| | Training Compliance | ≥98% | [Value]% | [Value]% | [↑/↓/→] | [Color] |

#### KPI Analysis and Insights

[Provide analysis of key trends, emerging patterns, areas of excellence, and concerns requiring attention. Include root causes for metrics not meeting targets and cross-functional impacts.]

#### Example:

**Manufacturing Quality KPIs**

| KPI | Target | Current Period | Previous Period | Trend | Status |
|-----|--------|----------------|----------------|-------|--------|
| Right First Time (RFT) | ≥95% | 93.2% | 91.8% | ↑ | Yellow |
| Batch Rejection Rate | ≤1% | 0.8% | 1.2% | ↑ | Green |
| Deviation Rate per Batch | ≤1.5 | 1.8 | 2.1 | ↑ | Yellow |

**Analysis:** Manufacturing KPIs show improving trends but RFT remains below target due to ongoing challenges in the sterile filling area. The investigation revealed that 65% of failures were related to environmental monitoring excursions following recent HVAC modifications. An engineering assessment has been completed and corrective actions are in implementation phase. Batch rejection rate has improved significantly due to enhanced pre-review process and operator training program implemented in Q1.

## Quality Metrics Dashboard Integration

### Dashboard Implementation

| Dashboard Element | Data Source | Update Frequency | Owner | User Access |
|-------------------|-------------|------------------|-------|------------|
| Executive Summary | Quality KPIs | Weekly | Quality Systems | Senior Management |
| Manufacturing Metrics | MES/EBR System | Daily | Manufacturing | Production/Quality |
| Lab Testing Metrics | LIMS | Daily | QC | Laboratory/Quality |
| CAPA Metrics | Quality Management System | Weekly | Quality Assurance | All Quality Staff |
| Supplier Metrics | ERP/Supplier Management System | Monthly | Supply Chain | Procurement/Quality |

### Dashboard Visualization Guidelines

**Design Principles:**
- Use consistent color scheme (Green/Yellow/Red for status indicators)
- Implement trend indicators (↑/↓/→) for performance over time
- Include both tabular data and graphical representations
- Establish standard thresholds for all metrics
- Provide drill-down capabilities for root cause analysis

**Key Visualization Components:**
1. Trend Charts - Display performance over 12-month period
2. Control Charts - Show process stability and capability
3. Pareto Charts - Identify most significant quality issues
4. Heat Maps - Highlight problem areas across products/processes
5. Scorecard Summary - Present high-level status for executive review

### Data Collection and Integration

| Data Type | Collection Method | System Integration | Data Quality Checks | Frequency |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| Manufacturing Data | Automated from MES | API Connection | Validation Rules | Real-time |
| Laboratory Data | Automated from LIMS | API Connection | Validation Rules | Daily |
| Deviation Data | Manual Entry/QMS | Database Query | Supervisory Review | Weekly |
| Audit Findings | Manual Entry | Database Query | QA Review | Per Audit |
| Customer Complaints | CRM System | API Connection | Investigation Verification | Weekly |

### Industry-Specific KPI Recommendations

**Pharmaceutical Manufacturing:**
- Process Capability Indices (Cpk)
- Particulate Matter Control
- Sterility Assurance Metrics
- Yield Consistency
- Cross-Contamination Control Effectiveness

**Biologics:**
- Cell Culture Performance
- Protein Yield
- Purification Efficiency
- Host Cell Protein Clearance
- Endotoxin Level Control

**Medical Devices:**

### Dashboard Review Process

**Review Frequency:**
- Daily Operational Review: Process-level metrics
- Weekly Management Review: Department-level metrics
- Monthly Executive Review: Site-level summary metrics
- Quarterly Quality Management Review: Comprehensive metrics package

**Integration with Quality Management Review:**
- Pre-meeting distribution of dashboard summary (3 days prior)
- Focus on exceptions and negative trends during review
- Record of dashboard metrics included in meeting minutes
- Action items linked to specific metrics requiring improvement

### Example Dashboard Metrics

**Executive Summary Dashboard:**

| Metric | Current | Target | Status | Trend | 12-Month Chart |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|-------|----------------|
| Overall Quality Score | 94.2% | ≥95% | Yellow | ↑ | [Sparkline] |
| CAPA Effectiveness | 92% | ≥90% | Green | ↑ | [Sparkline] |
| Batch Right First Time | 93.5% | ≥95% | Yellow | ↑ | [Sparkline] |
| Regulatory Compliance | 98.5% | ≥98% | Green | → | [Sparkline] |
| Complaint Rate (ppm) | 3.2 | ≤5.0 | Green | ↓ | [Sparkline] |
