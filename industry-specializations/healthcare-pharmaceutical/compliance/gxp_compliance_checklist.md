## Introduction and Purpose

### Background
This GxP Compliance Checklist serves as a comprehensive tool for evaluating compliance with Good Practice (GxP) requirements across various regulated activities in healthcare and pharmaceutical operations. GxP encompasses a collection of quality guidelines and regulations to ensure that products are safe, meet their intended use, and adhere to quality processes during manufacturing, control, storage, and distribution.

### Scope
This checklist applies to all activities, systems, facilities, and processes that fall under GxP regulations, including but not limited to research, development, manufacturing, testing, distribution, and clinical operations.

### Objectives
- Provide a structured framework for assessing GxP compliance status
- Identify compliance gaps requiring remediation
- Establish baseline measurements for ongoing compliance monitoring
- Support internal audit preparation and regulatory inspection readiness
- Drive continuous improvement in quality systems and processes

### How to Use This Checklist
1. Identify the applicable GxP areas and assessment categories relevant to your operations
2. Rate each compliance element using the defined scoring criteria
3. Document evidence supporting compliance ratings
4. Identify gaps and develop corrective action plans
5. Prioritize actions based on risk assessment
6. Establish timelines and responsibilities for remediation
7. Periodically reassess to verify improvement

## Assessment Criteria and Scoring

### Compliance Status Definitions

| Status | Definition |
|--------|------------|
| **C** (Compliant) | Fully compliant with requirements. Systems, procedures, and practices meet or exceed GxP requirements with robust evidence of implementation. |
| **NC** (Non-Compliant) | Does not meet GxP requirements. Significant gaps exist in systems, procedures, or implementation. |
| **PC** (Partially Compliant) | Some elements of compliance are present, but gaps exist that require remediation. |
| **NA** (Not Applicable) | Requirement does not apply to the operations being assessed. |

### Risk Categorization

| Risk Level | Definition | Response Required |
|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Critical** | Non-compliance presents immediate or significant risk to product quality, data integrity, or patient safety. Could result in regulatory action. | Immediate action required. Activities may need to be suspended until remediated. |
| **Major** | Significant deficiency in GxP system or implementation that could impact product quality or data integrity. | Prompt corrective action required with prioritized implementation. |
| **Minor** | Isolated deficiency with limited potential impact on quality systems. | Corrective action required within defined timeframe. |
| **Recommendation** | Opportunity for improvement in systems or practices that are currently compliant. | Consider for continuous improvement initiatives. |

### Scoring Methodology

Overall compliance score can be calculated for each section and for the entire assessment:

```
Compliance Score (%) = (Number of Compliant Items / Total Applicable Items) × 100
```

| Score Range | Compliance Rating | Action Required |
|-------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 90-100% | Excellent | Maintain systems with minor improvements |
| 75-89% | Good | Address identified gaps with planned approach |
| 60-74% | Fair | Significant improvements needed with prioritized action plan |
| <60% | Poor | Comprehensive remediation program required |
