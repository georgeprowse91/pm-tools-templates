1. Document the deviation on the test script where it occurred
2. Complete a Deviation Form (attached as Appendix A)
3. Classify the deviation as critical, major, or minor
4. Investigate the root cause of the deviation
5. Determine the impact on validation activities and product quality
6. Develop and implement corrective and preventive actions (CAPA)
7. Obtain appropriate approvals for the CAPA plan
8. Implement the approved CAPA plan
9. Verify effectiveness of the implemented actions
10. Close the deviation with final approval

### 9.2 Deviation Classification
Deviations will be classified according to the following criteria:

- **Major:** Significant impact on validation activities; potential indirect impact on product quality
- **Minor:** No impact on product quality; minimal impact on validation activities

### 9.3 Retest Requirements
Retest requirements will be determined based on the nature and classification of the deviation:
- Critical deviations: Complete revalidation may be required
- Major deviations: Partial revalidation may be required
- Minor deviations: Specific test rerun may be sufficient
