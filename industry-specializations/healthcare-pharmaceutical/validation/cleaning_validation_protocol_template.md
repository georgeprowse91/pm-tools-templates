### 4.3 Acceptance Criteria

#### 4.3.1 Visual Inspection
- All accessible product-contact surfaces must be visibly clean when inspected under [specify lighting conditions, e.g., 500 lux minimum]
- No visible residue, film, or discoloration

#### 4.3.2 Chemical Residue Limits
Limits for active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and cleaning agents are established based on:

**For API residue:**
- Maximum Allowable Carryover (MAC) = (Minimum Daily Dose of Previous Product × Safety Factor) / Maximum Daily Dose of Next Product
- Limit in terms of concentration = MAC / Minimum Batch Size of Next Product
- Limit per surface area = Limit in terms of concentration × Minimum Batch Size / Total Shared Surface Area

**Example calculation:**
- Safety factor: 0.001 (1/1000)
- Minimum daily dose of previous product (Product A): 10 mg
- Maximum daily dose of next product (Product B): 100 mg
- Minimum batch size of Product B: 100 kg
- Total shared surface area: 5 m²

MAC = (10 mg × 0.001) / 100 mg = 0.0001 mg/mg = 0.1 μg/mg
Limit in terms of concentration = 0.1 μg/mg × 1,000,000 mg/kg = 100,000 μg/kg
Limit per surface area = 100,000 μg/kg × 100 kg / 5 m² = 2,000,000 μg/m² = 2 mg/m² = 2 μg/cm²

**For cleaning agent residue:**
