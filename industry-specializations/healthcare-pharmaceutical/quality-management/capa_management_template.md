## 1. CAPA Overview

### Purpose and Scope

This template provides a framework for implementing a Corrective and Preventive Action (CAPA) system within a pharmaceutical, biotechnology, or medical device organization. The CAPA system described here is designed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, including:

- FDA 21 CFR Part 211 (Current Good Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals)
- FDA 21 CFR Part 820 (Quality System Regulation for Medical Devices)
- ICH Q10 Pharmaceutical Quality System
- ISO 13485 Medical Devices - Quality Management Systems
- EU GMP Chapter 1 (Pharmaceutical Quality System)

This CAPA process applies to:
- All quality-related issues identified through internal or external sources
- Deviations from established procedures, specifications, or quality standards
- Audit findings (internal, supplier, or regulatory)
- Customer complaints
- Adverse events and product quality issues
- Process monitoring trends indicating potential quality issues
- Any other situations requiring formal corrective or preventive actions

### Definitions

**Corrective Action**: Action taken to eliminate the cause of a detected nonconformity or other undesirable situation to prevent recurrence.

**Preventive Action**: Action taken to eliminate the cause of a potential nonconformity or other undesirable potential situation to prevent occurrence.

**Root Cause**: The fundamental, underlying reason for a nonconformity, defect, or failure.

**Effectiveness Check**: Verification that the implemented corrective and/or preventive action has effectively addressed the root cause and prevented recurrence or occurrence of the issue.

**CAPA Plan**: A documented plan outlining the actions, responsibilities, and timelines for implementing corrective and/or preventive actions.

**Quality Event**: Any occurrence that represents a deviation from established procedures, specifications, or quality standards, or that indicates a potential quality issue.

### Regulatory Framework

The CAPA system described in this template is designed to comply with:

| Regulation/Standard | Key Requirements |
|---------------------|------------------|
| FDA 21 CFR Part 211.192 | Investigation of discrepancies and failure of batches to meet specifications |
| FDA 21 CFR Part 820.100 | Establish and maintain procedures for implementing corrective and preventive action |
| ICH Q10 Section 3.2 | Corrective Action and Preventive Action (CAPA) System |
| ISO 13485 Section 8.5.2 and 8.5.3 | Corrective Action and Preventive Action requirements |
| EU GMP Chapter 1 | Continuous improvement through quality risk management |

Organizations should ensure their CAPA procedures align with the specific regulations applicable to their operations and geographic regions.

## 2. CAPA Process

### Issue Identification

#### Sources of Quality Events

Quality events requiring CAPA may be identified from various sources, including but not limited to:

- Internal quality audits
- External audits (regulatory, customer, certification bodies)
- Customer complaints
- Adverse event reports
- Deviation reports
- Out-of-specification (OOS) results
- Stability failures
- Process monitoring data
- Equipment failures
- Supplier issues
- Product returns
- Management review meetings
- Employee suggestions

#### Quality Event Assessment

Each identified quality event should be assessed for:

1. **Severity**: Impact on product quality, patient safety, data integrity, or regulatory compliance
2. **Probability**: Likelihood of recurrence if not addressed
3. **Detectability**: Ease of detecting the issue before it affects product quality
4. **Risk Level**: Combination of severity, probability, and detectability

The risk assessment should determine:
- Whether a CAPA is required
- The priority and timeline for addressing the CAPA
- The level of investigation required

**Example Risk Assessment Matrix:**

| Severity | Probability | Risk Level |
|----------|-------------|------------|
| High     | High        | Critical   |
| High     | Medium      | High       |
| High     | Low         | Medium     |
| Medium   | High        | High       |
| Medium   | Medium      | Medium     |
| Medium   | Low         | Low        |
| Low      | High        | Medium     |
| Low      | Medium      | Low        |
| Low      | Low         | Very Low   |

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Investigation Process

A thorough investigation should be conducted to identify the root cause(s) of the quality event. The investigation should:

1. Form an appropriate investigation team with relevant expertise
2. Gather and review data related to the quality event
3. Identify potential causes
4. Apply appropriate root cause analysis tools
5. Determine the root cause(s)
6. Document the investigation findings

#### Root Cause Analysis Tools

Select appropriate root cause analysis tools based on the complexity of the issue:

- **5 Whys**: A simple technique for drilling down to the root cause by asking "why" multiple times
- **Fishbone (Ishikawa) Diagram**: Identifies potential causes by categorizing them into major categories (e.g., Materials, Methods, Machines, People, Environment, Measurement)
- **Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)**: Systematically identifies potential failure modes and their impact
- **Fault Tree Analysis**: A deductive approach that starts with the undesired event and works backward to identify contributing factors
- **Process Mapping**: Visualizes the process to identify where issues may occur
- **Pareto Analysis**: Identifies the vital few issues causing the majority of problems

Detailed templates for these tools are provided in [Appendix B](#appendix-b-root-cause-analysis-tools).

### CAPA Plan Development

Based on the root cause analysis, develop a comprehensive CAPA plan that includes:

#### For Corrective Actions:

1. **Short-term containment actions**: Immediate steps to minimize the impact of the identified issue
2. **Corrective actions**: Actions to eliminate the root cause and prevent recurrence
3. **Verification actions**: Steps to verify that the corrective actions have been implemented as planned

#### For Preventive Actions:

1. **Preventive actions**: Actions to prevent the occurrence of potential issues
2. **Verification actions**: Steps to verify that the preventive actions have been implemented as planned

#### CAPA Plan Elements

Each CAPA plan should include:

- Unique CAPA identifier
- Description of the issue
- Root cause(s) identified
- Detailed action items
- Responsible individuals for each action
- Target completion dates
- Required resources
- Method for effectiveness verification
- Approval requirements

A CAPA plan template is provided in [Appendix C](#appendix-c-capa-plan-template).

### Implementation

#### Action Implementation

Implement the approved CAPA plan according to the specified timeline and requirements. For each action:

1. Assign clear responsibility for implementation
2. Allocate necessary resources
3. Document the implementation process
4. Update relevant procedures, if applicable
5. Provide training to affected personnel
6. Collect evidence of implementation

#### Implementation Challenges

Address common implementation challenges:

- **Resource constraints**: Identify alternative approaches or adjust timelines if needed
- **Technical challenges**: Seek expert assistance or revise the action plan
- **Organizational resistance**: Ensure management support and effective communication
- **Timeline delays**: Update the CAPA plan and inform stakeholders of revised timelines

### Effectiveness Check

#### Purpose

Effectiveness checks verify that the implemented corrective and preventive actions have:
- Addressed the root cause(s)
- Prevented recurrence of the issue (for corrective actions)
- Prevented occurrence of potential issues (for preventive actions)

#### Effectiveness Check Plan

The effectiveness check plan should include:

1. **Criteria**: Clear, measurable criteria for determining effectiveness
2. **Method**: How the effectiveness will be measured (e.g., monitoring data, audits, inspections)
3. **Timing**: When the effectiveness check will be conducted (typically after sufficient time to observe the impact)
4. **Responsibility**: Who will conduct the effectiveness check
5. **Documentation**: How the results will be documented

#### Outcomes

Possible outcomes of the effectiveness check:

- **Effective**: The CAPA has fully addressed the issue and can be closed
- **Partially Effective**: The CAPA has partially addressed the issue and requires additional actions
- **Not Effective**: The CAPA has not addressed the issue and requires reassessment of root causes and actions

An Effectiveness Check Form template is provided in [Appendix D](#appendix-d-effectiveness-check-form).

### Closure

A CAPA may be closed when:

1. All planned actions have been completed
2. Effectiveness has been verified
3. All required documentation is complete
4. Appropriate approvals have been obtained

The CAPA closure process should include:

- Final review of all CAPA documentation
- Verification that all action items are complete
- Confirmation that effectiveness checks demonstrate the CAPA was effective
- Approval by the designated authority (e.g., Quality Assurance)
- Archiving of CAPA records according to record retention requirements

## 3. Documentation Requirements

### Review and Approval Process

The CAPA process typically requires reviews and approvals at several stages:

#### CAPA Initiation
- Quality event assessment
- Decision to initiate a CAPA
- Assignment of investigation team

#### CAPA Plan
- Root cause analysis
- Proposed corrective and preventive actions
- Resource allocation
- Timeline commitments

#### CAPA Implementation

- Review of any deviations from the plan

#### CAPA Effectiveness
- Verification that effectiveness criteria have been met
- Decision on CAPA effectiveness

#### CAPA Closure
- Final review of all CAPA documentation
- Approval to close the CAPA

The appropriate level of approval should be based on the risk level of the quality event. High-risk CAPAs may require approval from senior management or the quality management review board.

## 4. Monitoring and Reporting

### CAPA Tracking System

#### System Requirements

An effective CAPA tracking system should:

- Maintain a central repository of all CAPAs
- Assign unique identifiers to each CAPA
- Track the status and progress of each CAPA
- Generate notifications for upcoming or overdue actions
- Support document attachment and storage
- Enable searching and filtering of CAPAs
- Generate reports for analysis and management review

#### Electronic vs. Paper-based Systems

Organizations may use:
