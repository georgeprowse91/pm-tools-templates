## 3. Monitoring Strategy

### 3.1 Risk-Based Monitoring Approach

This study will implement a risk-based monitoring (RBM) approach in accordance with ICH GCP E6(R2). The monitoring strategy is designed to focus on the critical data and processes that are essential to ensuring subject safety and the reliability of study results. 

The monitoring approach includes:
- Identification and risk assessment of critical study parameters
- Implementation of targeted monitoring activities based on risk level
- A combination of on-site and centralized monitoring techniques
- Ongoing risk review and adaptation of monitoring strategy as needed

The risk assessment has classified this study as [Low/Medium/High] risk, which informs the frequency and intensity of monitoring activities.

### 3.2 Critical Data and Processes

The following data and processes have been identified as critical to subject safety and study outcomes:

| Critical Data/Process | Rationale | Monitoring Approach |
|-----------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| Informed Consent Process | Ethical requirement and regulatory compliance | 100% on-site verification of process and documentation |
| Eligibility Criteria | Ensures appropriate subject population and subject safety | 100% verification of key inclusion/exclusion criteria |
| Primary Efficacy Endpoint Data | Direct impact on study outcomes | [X]% SDV and 100% SDR |
| Safety Data (AEs, SAEs, laboratory values) | Subject safety | [X]% SDV and 100% SDR |
| Study Drug Accountability | Compliance and subject safety | On-site verification at each monitoring visit |
| [Other critical data elements] | [Rationale] | [Approach] |

### 3.3 Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)
