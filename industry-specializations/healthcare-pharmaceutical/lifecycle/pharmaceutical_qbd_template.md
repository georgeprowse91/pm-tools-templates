# Pharmaceutical Quality by Design (QbD) Template

## Executive Summary
This template implements ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10 Quality by Design principles for pharmaceutical development projects.

## QbD Framework Overview
**Product:** [Drug name and indication]
**Development Phase:** [Phase I/II/III/Commercial]
**Regulatory Region:** [FDA/EMA/ICH]

## Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP)

### Product Characteristics
| Attribute | Target | Justification |
|-----------|--------|---------------|
| Dosage Form | [Tablet/Capsule/Injectable] | [Clinical rationale] |
| Route of Administration | [Oral/IV/IM/Topical] | [Patient need] |
| Dosage Strength | [mg/dose] | [Efficacy/Safety data] |
| Pharmacokinetics | [Target profile] | [Clinical requirements] |
| Stability | [Shelf life target] | [Commercial viability] |

### Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs)
- [ ] **Assay:** [90-110% of label claim]
- [ ] **Impurities:** [< specification limits]
- [ ] **Dissolution:** [Target profile]
- [ ] **Content Uniformity:** [AV ≤ 15.0]
- [ ] **Stability:** [ICH conditions]

## Risk Assessment (ICH Q9)

### Initial Risk Assessment
| CQA | Potential Risk | Severity | Probability | Risk Level |
|-----|----------------|----------|-------------|------------|
| Assay | Low potency | High | Medium | High |
| Impurities | Degradation | High | Low | Medium |
| Dissolution | Poor bioavailability | High | Medium | High |

### Risk Control Strategy
- High Risk → Design Space development required
- Medium Risk → Enhanced controls and monitoring
- Low Risk → Standard controls sufficient

## Design Space Development

### Manufacturing Process Design Space
**Unit Operations:**
- [ ] Blending: [Time, speed parameters]
- [ ] Granulation: [Wet/dry, conditions]
- [ ] Compression: [Force, speed ranges]
- [ ] Coating: [Conditions, parameters]

**Process Parameters:**
| Parameter | Range | Impact on CQA |
|-----------|-------|---------------|
| Blend time | [5-15 min] | Content uniformity |
| Compression force | [5-15 kN] | Hardness, dissolution |
| Coating weight gain | [2-4%] | Appearance, stability |
