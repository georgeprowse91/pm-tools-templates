- Cost-benefit analysis

## Best Practices and Methodologies

### Project Governance
- Establish robust governance frameworks with clear accountabilities
- Implement stage-gate approval processes for regulated environments
- Maintain thorough documentation for regulatory scrutiny
- Develop comprehensive audit trails of decisions and changes

### Methodology Selection
- **Waterfall**: Often used for regulatory compliance projects with fixed requirements
- **Agile**: Appropriate for digital transformation with proper governance controls
- **Hybrid**: Combining stage-gate approval with iterative development
- **Regulatory-aware agile**: Modified agile approaches incorporating compliance checkpoints
