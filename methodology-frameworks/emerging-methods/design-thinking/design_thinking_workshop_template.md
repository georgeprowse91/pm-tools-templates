### Managing Workshop Dynamics

#### Common Challenges and Solutions

**Challenge: Dominant Participants**
```
Symptoms:
├── One person speaking most of the time
├── Others becoming quiet or disengaged
├── Ideas coming from limited perspectives
└── Group energy becoming unbalanced

Interventions:
├── Use structured turn-taking methods
├── Implement silent brainstorming periods
├── Ask specific individuals for input
├── Break into smaller groups
├── Use anonymous idea collection
└── Set speaking time limits

Prevention:
├── Establish ground rules at the beginning
├── Use diverse activity formats
├── Rotate leadership roles
└── Create psychological safety for all voices
```

**Challenge: Low Energy or Engagement**
```
Symptoms:
├── Participants seem tired or distracted
├── Limited participation in activities
├── Minimal idea generation
└── Lack of enthusiasm for process

Interventions:
├── Take a movement or stretch break
├── Change physical environment or seating
├── Introduce a high-energy icebreaker
├── Share success stories or inspiration
├── Acknowledge progress made so far
└── Ask participants what they need

Prevention:
├── Plan regular breaks and movement
├── Vary activity types and energy levels
├── Provide adequate food and hydration
├── Check in regularly with participants
└── Celebrate small wins throughout
```
