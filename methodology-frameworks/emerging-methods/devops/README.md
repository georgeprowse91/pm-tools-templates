### Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
**Programmable Infrastructure:**
- **Declarative Configuration** - Infrastructure defined in code
- **Version Control** - Infrastructure changes tracked and reviewed
- **Automated Provisioning** - Consistent environment creation
- **Immutable Infrastructure** - Replace rather than modify
- **Compliance as Code** - Automated compliance validation

### Monitoring & Observability
**System Health & Performance:**
- **Application Monitoring** - Performance metrics and health checks
- **Infrastructure Monitoring** - Server, network, and storage metrics
- **Log Aggregation** - Centralized logging and analysis
