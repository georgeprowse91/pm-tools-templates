# MVP Planning Template

## Definition
A Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the version of a new product that allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.

## MVP Planning Framework

### 1. Problem Definition
**Customer Problem Statement**
- [ ] Clearly articulate the problem you're solving
- [ ] Identify target customer segment
- [ ] Validate problem significance
- [ ] Document problem urgency

```
Problem: [Describe the specific problem]
Customer Segment: [Who experiences this problem]
Pain Level: [How painful is this problem? Scale 1-10]
Current Solutions: [How do customers solve this today?]
```

### 2. Solution Hypothesis
**Proposed Solution**
- [ ] Define your solution approach
- [ ] Identify key value proposition
- [ ] List critical assumptions
- [ ] Estimate effort required

```
Solution Hypothesis: We believe that [customer segment] 
experiences [problem] and that they will [desired behavior] 
if we provide [solution feature].
```

### 3. MVP Feature Scope

#### Must-Have Features (Core)
- [ ] Feature 1: [Description]
  - User story: [As a... I want... So that...]
  - Success criteria: [How will you know it works?]
- [ ] Feature 2: [Description]
- [ ] Feature 3: [Description]

#### Nice-to-Have Features (Future)
- Feature A: [Description]
- Feature B: [Description]
- Feature C: [Description]

### 4. Success Metrics

#### Primary Metrics (Leading Indicators)
- [ ] User activation rate: Target [X]%
- [ ] Feature usage frequency: Target [X] times per week
- [ ] Customer acquisition cost: Target $[X]
- [ ] User retention rate: Target [X]% after 30 days

#### Secondary Metrics (Lagging Indicators)
- [ ] Customer lifetime value: Target $[X]
- [ ] Net Promoter Score: Target [X]
- [ ] Revenue per user: Target $[X]
- [ ] Market penetration: Target [X]%

### 5. Learning Objectives

#### Key Questions to Answer
1. Will customers actually use this solution?
2. Does the solution adequately solve the problem?
3. Are customers willing to pay for this solution?
4. How do customers discover and adopt the solution?
5. What drives customer retention and engagement?

#### Hypotheses to Test
- [ ] Hypothesis 1: [Specific, testable statement]
- [ ] Hypothesis 2: [Specific, testable statement]
- [ ] Hypothesis 3: [Specific, testable statement]

### 6. MVP Implementation Plan

#### Development Approach
- [ ] **Concierge MVP**: Manual service to test demand
- [ ] **Wizard of Oz MVP**: Fake automation with manual backend
- [ ] **Landing Page MVP**: Test interest before building
- [ ] **Prototype MVP**: Functional but basic version
- [ ] **Single-Feature MVP**: One core feature implementation

#### Timeline and Resources
```
Phase 1 (Weeks 1-2): [Activities]
Phase 2 (Weeks 3-4): [Activities]
Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6): [Activities]

Team Size: [X] people
Budget Required: $[X]
Key Dependencies: [List critical dependencies]
```

### 7. Customer Validation Plan

#### Target Customers
- [ ] Customer segment 1: [Demographics, behaviors]
- [ ] Customer segment 2: [Demographics, behaviors]
- [ ] Total target customers for initial validation: [X]

#### Validation Methods
- [ ] Customer interviews (Target: [X] interviews)
- [ ] Surveys (Target: [X] responses)
- [ ] User testing sessions (Target: [X] sessions)
- [ ] A/B testing (Target: [X] participants)
- [ ] Usage analytics tracking

### 8. Risk Assessment

#### High-Risk Assumptions
1. **Risk**: [Description]
   - Impact: High/Medium/Low
   - Probability: High/Medium/Low
   - Mitigation: [Strategy]

2. **Risk**: [Description]
   - Impact: High/Medium/Low
   - Probability: High/Medium/Low
   - Mitigation: [Strategy]

#### Pivot Triggers
- [ ] If user activation rate < [X]% after [Y] weeks
- [ ] If customer acquisition cost > $[X]
- [ ] If user retention rate < [X]% after 30 days
- [ ] If [specific negative feedback pattern]

### 9. Post-MVP Planning

#### Success Scenario
- [ ] Scale successful features
- [ ] Expand to additional customer segments
- [ ] Add complementary features
- [ ] Optimize conversion funnel

#### Pivot Scenario
- [ ] Customer segment pivot
- [ ] Problem pivot
- [ ] Solution approach pivot
- [ ] Business model pivot

### 10. Stakeholder Communication

#### Internal Updates
- [ ] Weekly progress reports
- [ ] Monthly metric reviews
- [ ] Quarterly strategy sessions
- [ ] Decision checkpoints

#### Customer Communication
- [ ] Beta user feedback collection
- [ ] Feature request tracking
- [ ] Customer support integration
- [ ] Community building activities
