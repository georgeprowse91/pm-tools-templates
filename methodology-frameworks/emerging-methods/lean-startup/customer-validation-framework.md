# Customer Validation Framework

## Overview
Customer validation is the process of testing whether customers actually want your product and will pay for it. This framework provides systematic approaches to validate your customer assumptions and product-market fit.

## Validation Stages

### Stage 1: Problem Validation
**Objective**: Confirm that the problem you're solving is real and important to customers

#### Problem Interview Guide
```
Duration: 15-30 minutes
Target: 20-50 interviews per customer segment

Opening (2 minutes):
- Thank them for their time
- Explain you're researching a problem area
- Ask permission to record (optional)
- Emphasize you're learning, not selling

Problem Discovery (10-15 minutes):
1. "Tell me about how you currently handle [problem area]?"
2. "What's the hardest part about [current process]?"
3. "How much time do you spend on [problem] per week?"
4. "What tools/solutions do you currently use?"
5. "What don't you like about current solutions?"
6. "If you could wave a magic wand and solve this problem perfectly, what would that look like?"

Demographic Questions (5 minutes):
- Role/title, company size, industry
- Decision-making authority
- Budget responsibility
- Technical proficiency

Closing:
- Ask for referrals to others with similar problems
- Request permission for follow-up
```

#### Problem Validation Criteria
- [ ] At least 75% of interviewees confirm the problem exists
- [ ] Problem causes significant pain (rated 7+ out of 10)
- [ ] Customers actively seek solutions today
- [ ] Current solutions are inadequate
- [ ] Customers have budget to solve the problem

### Stage 2: Solution Validation
**Objective**: Test whether your proposed solution adequately addresses the validated problem

#### Solution Presentation Methods
1. **Problem-Solution Narrative**
   - Present the problem story
   - Introduce your solution concept
   - Gauge reaction and interest

2. **Mockup/Wireframe Demo**
   - Show visual representation
   - Walk through key user flows
   - Collect feedback on features

3. **Prototype Testing**
   - Interactive but basic version
   - User task completion
   - Usability observations

#### Solution Interview Guide
```
Duration: 20-45 minutes
Target: Previous problem interview participants + new prospects

Setup (3 minutes):
- Recap previous conversation (if applicable)
- Introduce solution concept
- Set expectations for feedback session

Solution Presentation (10-15 minutes):
1. Present problem summary
2. Introduce your solution
3. Demo key features/workflows
4. Explain key benefits

Feedback Collection (15-20 minutes):
1. "What's your first reaction to this solution?"
2. "How well does this solve the problem we discussed?"
3. "What would you change or improve?"
4. "What features are most/least important?"
5. "How does this compare to what you use today?"
6. "Would you be willing to try this if it existed?"
7. "What would prevent you from using this?"

Purchase Intent (5 minutes):
1. "If this solution existed today, would you use it?"
2. "Would you pay for this? How much?"
3. "Who else would need to approve this purchase?"
4. "What would convince you to switch from your current solution?"
```

#### Solution Validation Criteria

- [ ] Solution addresses top 3 customer pain points
- [ ] Customers prefer your approach over alternatives
- [ ] Clear differentiation from existing solutions
- [ ] Feasible implementation within resource constraints

### Stage 3: Product Validation

   - Learn customer workflows
   - Validate value proposition

3. **Wizard of Oz MVP**
   - Automated frontend, manual backend
   - Test user experience
   - Validate technical assumptions

4. **Beta Testing Program**
   - Limited feature release
   - Real customer usage
   - Iterate based on feedback

#### Product Validation Metrics
```
Metric: User Activation Rate
- Definition: % of users who complete key action within first session
- Target: 40%+ for B2B, 25%+ for B2C
- Measurement: Analytics tracking

Metric: Feature Adoption Rate

- Target: 50+ (promoters - detractors)
- Measurement: In-app surveys

Metric: Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
- Definition: Total cost to acquire one customer
- Target: 3x lower than Customer Lifetime Value
- Measurement: Marketing spend / new customers
```

### Stage 4: Willingness to Pay Validation
**Objective**: Confirm customers will actually pay the proposed price

#### Pricing Validation Methods
1. **Price Sensitivity Survey**
   - Van Westendorp Price Sensitivity Meter
   - Conjoint analysis
   - Direct price questioning

2. **A/B Price Testing**
   - Test different price points
   - Measure conversion rates
   - Analyze customer segments

3. **Pre-sales/Pre-orders**
   - Collect actual commitments
   - Validate demand at specific price
   - Generate early revenue

#### Pricing Interview Questions
```
1. "What do you currently spend on solving this problem?"
2. "How much would you expect to pay for a solution like this?"
3. "At what price would this be too expensive?"
4. "At what price would you question the quality?"
5. "What's your budget for this type of solution?"
6. "Who controls the budget for this purchase?"
7. "What's your procurement process?"
8. "Would you prefer monthly/annual billing?"
```

## Common Validation Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Confirmation Bias**: Only talking to people who agree with you
2. **Leading Questions**: Asking questions that suggest the answer
3. **Feature Creep**: Adding features without validating demand
4. **Sample Size Too Small**: Making decisions on insufficient data
5. **Wrong Customer Segment**: Talking to users instead of buyers
6. **Vanity Metrics**: Focusing on metrics that don't predict success
7. **No Follow-up**: Failing to re-validate with the same customers
8. **Ignoring Negative Feedback**: Dismissing criticism too quickly

*Remember: Validation is an ongoing process, not a one-time event*
*Continue validating as you scale and enter new markets*
