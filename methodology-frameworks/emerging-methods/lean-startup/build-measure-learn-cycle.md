# Build-Measure-Learn Cycle Template

## Overview
The Build-Measure-Learn feedback loop is the core component of the Lean Startup methodology. This template guides you through each phase of the cycle to maximize validated learning.

## Cycle Structure

### 🔨 BUILD Phase
**Objective**: Create the minimum viable product or feature to test hypotheses

#### Planning
- [ ] Define hypothesis to test
- [ ] Identify minimum features needed
- [ ] Set build timeline (recommended: 1-4 weeks)
- [ ] Assign team resources

#### Execution
- [ ] Build MVP or feature increment
- [ ] Ensure tracking/analytics implementation
- [ ] Prepare measurement tools
- [ ] Document assumptions made during build

### 📊 MEASURE Phase
**Objective**: Collect data on customer behavior and product performance

#### Metrics Setup
- [ ] Define key metrics (leading and lagging indicators)
- [ ] Set up data collection mechanisms
- [ ] Establish baseline measurements
- [ ] Create measurement dashboard

#### Data Collection
- [ ] Launch product/feature to target segment
- [ ] Monitor user behavior and engagement
- [ ] Collect quantitative data
- [ ] Gather qualitative feedback
- [ ] Document unexpected findings

### 🎓 LEARN Phase
**Objective**: Generate validated learning and decide next steps

#### Analysis
- [ ] Compare results to hypothesis
- [ ] Identify patterns in user behavior
- [ ] Calculate key performance indicators
- [ ] Synthesize quantitative and qualitative data

#### Decision Making
- [ ] Determine if hypothesis was validated
- [ ] Choose next action:
  - **Persevere**: Continue with current approach
  - **Pivot**: Change fundamental hypothesis
  - **Iterate**: Make incremental improvements

#### Documentation
- [ ] Record lessons learned
- [ ] Update product roadmap
- [ ] Share insights with stakeholders
- [ ] Plan next cycle

## Cycle Tracking

| Cycle # | Start Date | Build Duration | Hypothesis Tested | Result | Next Action |
|---------|------------|----------------|-------------------|---------|-------------|
| 1       |            |                |                   |         |             |
| 2       |            |                |                   |         |             |
| 3       |            |                |                   |         |             |

## Key Performance Indicators

### Product Metrics
- User acquisition rate
- User engagement/retention
- Feature adoption rate
- User satisfaction score

### Learning Metrics
- Hypothesis validation rate
- Cycle time (Build-Measure-Learn duration)
- Customer interview completion rate
- Experiment success rate

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Building too much**: Keep MVPs minimal
2. **Measuring vanity metrics**: Focus on actionable metrics
3. **Learning without action**: Always plan next steps
4. **Skipping customer feedback**: Prioritize qualitative insights
5. **Long cycle times**: Aim for rapid iteration
