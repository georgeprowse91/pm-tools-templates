# Hypothesis-Driven Planning Template

## Overview
Hypothesis-driven planning transforms assumptions into testable hypotheses that can be validated or invalidated through experiments. This approach reduces risk by testing the riskiest assumptions first.

## Hypothesis Framework

### Hypothesis Structure
```
We believe that [customer segment] has [problem/need] 
and will [desired behavior] when we provide [solution] 
because [underlying assumption].

We will know this is true when we see [measurable outcome] 
within [time period] with [success criteria].
```

### Example Hypothesis
```
We believe that busy working parents have difficulty finding healthy meal options for their families 
and will subscribe to a meal planning service when we provide personalized, quick recipes 
because they value their time but want to maintain healthy eating habits.

We will know this is true when we see 25% of surveyed parents sign up for our beta service 
within 2 weeks with at least 70% completing their first meal plan.
```

## Hypothesis Categories

### 1. Customer Problem Hypotheses
**Focus**: Validating that the problem exists and is significant

#### Template
```
Customer Problem Hypothesis #[X]:
We believe [customer segment] experiences [specific problem] 
and this problem causes [impact/frustration] 
because [underlying cause].

Validation Method: [How will you test this?]
Success Criteria: [What would prove this true?]
Timeline: [When will you test this?]
Risk Level: [High/Medium/Low]
```

#### Examples
- "We believe small business owners struggle with social media content creation and this causes missed marketing opportunities because they lack time and expertise."
- "We believe college students have difficulty managing their finances and this causes stress and poor financial decisions because they lack financial education and tools."

### 2. Customer Solution Hypotheses
**Focus**: Validating that your solution addresses the problem effectively

#### Template
```
Customer Solution Hypothesis #[X]:
We believe [customer segment] will adopt [solution approach] 
to solve [problem] and will prefer it over [current alternatives] 
because [unique value proposition].

Validation Method: [How will you test this?]
Success Criteria: [What would prove this true?]
Timeline: [When will you test this?]
Risk Level: [High/Medium/Low]
```

### 3. Customer Acquisition Hypotheses
**Focus**: Validating how customers will discover and try your solution

#### Template
```
Customer Acquisition Hypothesis #[X]:
We believe [customer segment] will discover our solution through [channel] 
and will engage with [marketing message/approach] 
because [motivation/trigger].

Validation Method: [How will you test this?]
Success Criteria: [What would prove this true?]
Timeline: [When will you test this?]
Risk Level: [High/Medium/Low]
```

### 4. Revenue Model Hypotheses
**Focus**: Validating how you'll make money and pricing

#### Template
```
Revenue Model Hypothesis #[X]:
We believe [customer segment] will pay [price] for [solution] 
via [payment model] and will find this price [acceptable/valuable] 
because [value justification].

Validation Method: [How will you test this?]
Success Criteria: [What would prove this true?]
Timeline: [When will you test this?]
Risk Level: [High/Medium/Low]
```

### 5. Growth Hypotheses
**Focus**: Validating how your business will scale

#### Template
```
Growth Hypothesis #[X]:
We believe customers will [growth mechanism] our solution 
at a rate of [frequency/volume] 
because [motivation for sharing/expanding].

Validation Method: [How will you test this?]
Success Criteria: [What would prove this true?]
Timeline: [When will you test this?]
Risk Level: [High/Medium/Low]
```

## Hypothesis Registry

### Active Hypotheses Tracking

| ID | Category | Hypothesis | Validation Method | Success Criteria | Status | Results |
|----|----------|------------|-------------------|------------------|---------|---------|
| H1 | Problem | [Brief description] | [Method] | [Criteria] | Testing | [Outcome] |
| H2 | Solution | [Brief description] | [Method] | [Criteria] | Validated | [Outcome] |
| H3 | Acquisition | [Brief description] | [Method] | [Criteria] | Invalidated | [Outcome] |

### Hypothesis Status Definitions
- **Draft**: Hypothesis identified but not yet formulated
- **Testing**: Experiment in progress
- **Validated**: Evidence supports the hypothesis
- **Invalidated**: Evidence contradicts the hypothesis
- **Needs More Data**: Results inconclusive, requires additional testing

## Experiment Design for Hypotheses

```

### Common Experiment Types

- **Survey Research**: 100+ responses from target segment
- **Observation Studies**: Watch customers in their natural environment
- **Jobs-to-be-Done Analysis**: Understand underlying motivations

#### 2. Solution Validation Experiments

- **A/B Testing**: Compare different solution approaches

#### 3. Acquisition Validation Experiments

## Hypothesis Prioritization

### Risk Assessment Framework
Rate each hypothesis on two dimensions:

#### Impact if Wrong (1-5)
1. Minor setback
2. Moderate resource waste
3. Significant pivot required
4. Major strategy change
5. Business failure

#### Confidence Level (1-5)
1. Wild guess
2. Some evidence
3. Moderate evidence
4. Strong evidence
5. Nearly certain

### Prioritization Matrix
```
High Impact, Low Confidence = TEST FIRST (Highest Priority)
High Impact, High Confidence = Monitor
Low Impact, Low Confidence = TEST LATER (Lower Priority)
Low Impact, High Confidence = Assume True
```

### Testing Sequence
1. **Critical Path Hypotheses**: Must be true for business to work
2. **High Risk/Low Confidence**: Could kill the business if wrong
3. **Customer Problem Validation**: Foundation for everything else
4. **Solution Validation**: Core product-market fit
5. **Business Model Validation**: Revenue and growth mechanisms

## Hypothesis Learning Loop

- [ ] Define sample size and duration
- [ ] Set up measurement systems
- [ ] Plan resource allocation

### 3. Run Experiment
- [ ] Execute according to plan
- [ ] Collect data systematically
- [ ] Document observations
- [ ] Avoid confirmation bias

### 4. Analyze Results
- [ ] Compare results to success criteria

## Common Hypothesis Planning Mistakes

### 1. Vague Hypotheses
❌ "Customers will like our product"
✅ "Busy professionals will use our meal planning app at least 3 times per week because it saves them 2+ hours of meal planning time"

### 2. Untestable Assumptions
❌ "We believe customers want better design"
✅ "We believe customers will choose our product over competitors when design is 20% more polished based on usability testing scores"

### 3. Testing Multiple Variables
❌ Testing price, features, and messaging simultaneously
✅ Testing one variable at a time to isolate cause and effect

### 4. Confirmation Bias
❌ Only looking for evidence that supports your hypothesis
✅ Actively seeking evidence that could disprove your hypothesis

### 5. Insufficient Sample Size
❌ Making decisions based on 3-5 customer conversations
✅ Using statistically significant sample sizes for quantitative tests

- Example: B2B to B2C or different industry vertical

#### 2. Customer Problem Pivot
- Change the problem you're solving for the same customer segment
- Example: From productivity to communication tools

#### 3. Solution Approach Pivot
- Change how you solve the problem while keeping customer and problem
- Example: From mobile app to web platform

#### 4. Revenue Model Pivot
- Change how you make money while keeping customer, problem, and solution
- Example: From subscription to transaction-based pricing

#### 5. Channel Pivot
- Change how you reach customers
- Example: From direct sales to partner channel

*Remember: The goal is not to validate all your hypotheses, but to learn quickly and cheaply what works and what doesn't*
*Failed hypotheses are successful learning experiences if they inform better decisions*
