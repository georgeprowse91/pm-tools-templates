# Lean Startup Methodology Framework

## Overview

The Lean Startup methodology provides a scientific approach to creating and managing successful startups in an age of uncertainty. This framework emphasizes rapid prototyping, validated learning, and iterative product releases to shorten development cycles.

## Core Principles

1. **Build-Measure-Learn**: The fundamental feedback loop
2. **Validated Learning**: Learning through scientific experimentation
3. **Innovation Accounting**: Measuring progress in uncertain environments
4. **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**: The simplest version that enables learning
5. **Pivot or Persevere**: Data-driven decision making

## Templates Included

### Planning Templates
- [Build-Measure-Learn Cycle Template](build-measure-learn-cycle.md)
- [MVP Planning Template](mvp-planning-template.md)
- [Hypothesis-Driven Planning Template](hypothesis-driven-planning.md)
- [Lean Canvas Template](lean-canvas-template.md)

### Validation Templates
- [Customer Validation Framework](customer-validation-framework.md)
- [Experiment Design Template](experiment-design-template.md)
- [Pivot Decision Framework](pivot-decision-framework.md)

## Quick Start

1. Begin with the [Lean Canvas Template](lean-canvas-template.md) to outline your business model
2. Use the [MVP Planning Template](mvp-planning-template.md) to define your minimum viable product
3. Apply the [Build-Measure-Learn Cycle Template](build-measure-learn-cycle.md) for iterative development
4. Validate assumptions using the [Customer Validation Framework](customer-validation-framework.md)

## Integration with Traditional PM

- **Agile**: Complements Scrum/Kanban with customer-focused metrics
- **Traditional**: Provides structured approach to uncertainty management
- **Hybrid**: Enables adaptive planning within structured governance

## Success Metrics

- Customer acquisition cost (CAC)
- Customer lifetime value (CLV)
- Product-market fit indicators
- Learning velocity
- Pivot frequency and success rate
