# Pivot Decision Framework

## Overview
A pivot is a structured course correction designed to test a new fundamental hypothesis about the product, strategy, and engine of growth. This framework helps you determine when to pivot and what type of pivot to make.

## What is a Pivot?

### Definition
A pivot is NOT a failure—it's a strategic change based on validated learning that maintains one foot rooted in what you've learned while making a fundamental change to your business model.

### Pivot vs. Iteration
- **Iteration**: Small changes to improve existing approach
- **Pivot**: Fundamental change to core business hypothesis

*Remember: Pivoting is not failure—it's intelligent adaptation based on learning*
*The goal is to find a sustainable business model, not to prove your original idea was right*
